      ### What is Token House?


      Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which
      was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum,
      community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. 


      The Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract
      for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is
      where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the
      voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly
      interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast
      their votes on-chain.


      ### How to become a Token House Member?


      There are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a
      part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops,
      which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on
      specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early
      adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.


      Another way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading
      platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for
      purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing
      the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token
      market and can commence trading.


      Furthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents
      opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the
      development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify
      for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism
      community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication
      channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for
      earning tokens.


      The Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by
      providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance
      proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in
      meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future,
      additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be
      developed to further enhance the governance experience.


      ### Role of OP Token Holders


      **Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the
      opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      **Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements
      to the protocol.


      **Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important
      matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.


      **Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they
      play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the
      Optimism network.


      ### Proposals

      </div>


      Grant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the
      Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the
      [Grants Council: Internal Operating
      Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832).
      Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the
      [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism
      community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard
      proposal
      template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443)
      and contain relevant information.


      ### Voting on Proposals


      Currently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract.
      However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the
      Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the
      voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and
      follow the specified voting process. 


      To move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit
      approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current
      votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a
      specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their
      approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather
      indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a
      proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should
      update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle
      Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.


      ### Future Submissions


      If a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes
      to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the
      community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This
      ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and
      refinement before moving forward in the governance process.

      A Token House governance proposal is considered valid when it meets
      specific criteria related to the number of votes:


      ### Quorum

      This refers to the minimum number of total OP votes, which includes
      abstain votes, that must be cast for a proposal to be eligible. Quorum is
      calculated as a percentage of the total votable OP supply at the start of
      the voting period. The "votable supply" encompasses the OP tokens that
      have been delegated and are eligible to participate in the voting
      process. 


      ### Approval Threshold

      To approve a proposal, a minimum number of OP votes must be in favor of
      it. The approval threshold for each proposal is determined as a percentage
      of the votes cast in favor of approval relative to the total number of yes
      and no votes. Abstain votes are not included in this calculation.


      The table below showcases different requirements for submission and
      approval of each proposal type:

      ### Seasons & Voting Cycles


      Seasons are distinct periods of governance operations, each with its own
      unique timeline and objectives. These seasons are organized and scheduled
      to facilitate decision-making and governance within the Token House
      ecosystem. 


      Voting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token
      holders participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last
      for five weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing,
      and voting on governance proposals. 


      These cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on
      Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the
      community actively participates in voting on various proposals.

      Reflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the
      governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow
      for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's
      structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's
      delve deeper into how these cycles work.


      ### Reflection Periods

      Reflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During
      these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to
      the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals
      aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that
      the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.


      To allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide
      critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active
      votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time
      for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to
      contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.


      ### Special Voting Cycles

      Following the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted.
      These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify
      the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes
      made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the
      collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving
      needs of the community.


      To stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance
      calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable
      resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and
      progression of the governance process.

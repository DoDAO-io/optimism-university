      Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which
      was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum,
      community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. As members of Token House,
      OP holders have the responsibility to participate in the governance
      process by submitting, deliberating, and voting on various proposals.


      The Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract
      for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is
      where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the
      voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly
      interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast
      their votes on-chain.


      The Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by
      providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance
      proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in
      meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future,
      additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be
      developed to further enhance the governance experience.


      ### Proposals

      Grant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the
      Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the
      [Grants Council: Internal Operating
      Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832).
      Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the
      [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism
      community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard
      proposal
      template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443)
      and contain relevant information.


      ### Voting Process


      Currently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract.
      However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the
      Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the
      voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and
      follow the specified voting process. 


      To move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit
      approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current
      votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a
      specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their
      approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather
      indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a
      proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should
      update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle
      Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.


      ### Future Submissions


      If a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes
      to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the
      community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This
      ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and
      refinement before moving forward in the governance process.

      Reflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the
      governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow
      for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's
      structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's
      delve deeper into how these cycles work.


      During each Season, Token House voting takes place through five-week
      voting cycles. These cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST)
      and conclude on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these
      cycles that the community actively participates in voting on various
      proposals.


      ### Reflection Periods

      Reflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During
      these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to
      the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals
      aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that
      the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.


      To allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide
      critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active
      votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time
      for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to
      contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.


      ### Special Voting Cycles

      Following the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted.
      These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify
      the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes
      made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the
      collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving
      needs of the community.


      To stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance
      calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable
      resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and
      progression of the governance process.

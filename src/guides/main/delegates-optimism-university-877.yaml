      ### Who is a Delegate?


      Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, offering
      faster and more cost-effective transactions. The Optimism blockchain,
      built on the Ethereum network, is one such innovative technology. It
      utilizes a unique system of delegates to manage the governance of the
      network. 


      In the Optimism blockchain, a delegate is an individual selected to make
      governance decisions on behalf of token holders. Token holders have the
      option to delegate their voting power to someone else, who will then
      represent them in decision-making processes. It is important to note that
      token holders retain full ownership of their tokens and can change their
      delegates at any time.


      ### Role of Delegates

      Delegates in the Optimism blockchain are responsible for managing the
      governance of the network. They propose, vote, and execute changes to the
      network, ensuring its smooth operation. To be eligible for election as a
      delegate, individuals must meet specific criteria, such as holding a
      minimum number of tokens and having a good reputation within the
      community.

      </div>


      Once elected, delegates can propose changes to the network, such as
      protocol upgrades or modifications to the fee structure. These proposals
      are then put to a vote, allowing token holders to express their support or
      opposition. The proposal with the highest number of votes is executed, and
      the delegate is responsible for implementing the approved changes.


      Delegates play a crucial role in the governance of the Optimism
      blockchain. By allowing token holders to delegate their voting power, the
      network becomes more democratic and less susceptible to control by a small
      group of individuals. Delegates ensure that the network is managed in a
      fair and transparent manner, preventing centralization and promoting
      inclusivity.


      As blockchain technology evolves, it is essential to have a mechanism in
      place for making necessary changes to the network. Delegates provide this
      mechanism in the Optimism blockchain. They help ensure that the network
      remains up-to-date and secure by proposing and implementing upgrades and
      maintenance activities.

      Participating in Token House governance can be a time-consuming task. To
      alleviate this burden, individuals have the option to delegate their
      voting power to community members who have volunteered to actively
      participate in Token House governance. However, being a delegate is not a
      responsibility to be taken lightly. Before deciding to become a delegate,
      it is crucial to understand the responsibilities and commitments that come
      with this role. Let's explore the steps to becoming a delegate and the
      expectations associated with it:


      ### Commit

      The first step towards becoming a delegate is to familiarize yourself with
      the delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities can be found on the
      [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) dedicated to
      Token House governance. It is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend
      these responsibilities to ensure that you are fully aware of what is
      expected from you as a delegate. Understanding these responsibilities will
      help you make an informed decision about whether or not you are ready to
      take on this role.

      </div>


      ### Set up Profile

      Once you have familiarized yourself with the delegate responsibilities,
      the next step is to register as a delegate on the [Optimism Governance
      Portal (Optimism Agora)](https://vote.optimism.io/). This portal serves as
      the platform for Token House governance, and registering as a delegate
      will allow you to actively participate in the decision-making process. To
      register, you will need to complete the [delegate commitment
      form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) provided on the
      portal. This form will require you to provide relevant information and
      agree to fulfill your responsibilities as a delegate.


      While not mandatory, it is advisable to delegate your own OP tokens'
      voting power to yourself. By doing so, you retain control over your voting
      power and can actively participate in the decision-making process.
      Self-delegating ensures that your voice is heard and that you have a say
      in the governance of Token House. However, it is important to note that
      token grants should not be self-delegated to grant recipients. This
      ensures fairness and prevents any conflicts of interest.

      Existing delegates play a crucial role in the governance process. By
      keeping in mind the following guidelines, delegates can effectively
      contribute to the decision-making process and help shape the future of the
      community:


      ### 1. Join Discord Channels

      As an existing delegate, it is important to actively participate in the
      governance discussions. Join the relevant channels on
      [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) to engage in conversations
      with other delegates and stay updated on important governance events. The
      [#gov-general
      channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919)
      is specifically designed for general governance discussions, while the
      [#token-house-gov
      channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/991340698995544176)
      provides announcements about significant events in the governance process.
      Additionally, the [#grants
      channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1069653708369047623)
      allows delegates to discuss the grants process and provide feedback to
      grant applicants. Lastly, the [#delegate-discussion
      channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241)
      is a platform for larger delegates to collaborate and discuss proposals
      and the overall governance process.


      ### 2. Provide Feedback

      To contribute to the decision-making process, delegates should provide
      feedback on draft proposals. This can be done in the [Proposals
      Discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38) section of the Forum.
      By sharing your thoughts and insights, you can help shape the direction of
      the proposals and ensure that they align with the interests of the
      community. Remember, your feedback can have a significant impact on the
      final outcome of the proposals.

      </div>


      ### 3. Approve Non-Grant Proposals

      If you possess more than 0.5% of the voting supply, you have the authority
      to approve non-grant proposals. To exercise this power, simply post the
      following phrase in a forum comment on Discourse: "I am an Optimism
      delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready
      to move to a vote." By approving proposals, you contribute to the
      decision-making process and help determine which proposals should proceed
      to the voting stage.


      ### 4. Vote on Non-Grant Proposals

      As an existing delegate, it is crucial to exercise your voting power on
      non-grant proposals. Utilize the [Optimism Governance
      Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/) to cast your vote and make your voice
      heard. Remember to carefully consider the proposals and their potential
      impact on the community before making your decision. Additionally, after
      voting, it is recommended to provide a voting rationale in a [Delegate
      Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This
      allows you to explain your decision and engage in further discussions with
      other delegates.


      ### 5. Stay Up to Date

      To effectively fulfill your role as a delegate, it is essential to stay
      informed about voting cycles and general governance updates. The
      Governance section of the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41)
      provides valuable information on these matters. Additionally, the
      [governance
      calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
      highlights when important governance calls take place. By staying up to
      date, you can actively participate in the decision-making process and
      contribute to the overall governance of the community.

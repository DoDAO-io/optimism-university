      Participating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a
      time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to
      delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to
      actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not
      to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself
      in order to vote. Let's explore the process of delegating tokens, the
      importance of choosing the right delegate, and the steps involved in
      delegating tokens to yourself:


      ### Choosing Your Delegate

      Delegating your voting power is a crucial decision, so it is essential to
      take the time to read through delegate statements of interest. These
      statements provide insights into the delegate's stance on various
      governance matters. By carefully considering these statements, you can
      select a delegate who aligns with your values and priorities. Remember, a
      healthy governance system benefits both Optimism and all OP token holders.


      ### Delegating Tokens

      Delegating tokens to a representative allows you to transfer your voting
      power to someone who will actively participate in Token House governance
      on your behalf. By doing so, you retain 100% ownership of your tokens and
      can use them as you wish. To delegate your tokens, you can visit the
      [delegates app](https://app.optimism.io/delegates) and follow the
      instructions provided. It is important to note that delegate voting power
      is measured at the start of every voting period, which occurs every five
      weeks.


      ### Delegate Communications Thread:

      Once you have delegated your tokens, your chosen delegate should provide
      reasoning behind their votes in a [Delegate Communications
      Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This thread serves as a
      platform for delegates to explain their decision-making process and engage
      with the community. By reviewing these communications, you can stay
      informed about the actions and decisions made on your behalf.


      ### Delegating Tokens to Yourself:

      If you prefer not to delegate your voting power to a representative, you
      have the option to delegate to yourself. By following the [delegate
      commitment template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235)
      on the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/), you can
      register as a delegate and retain full control over your voting power.
      Once you have been added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can
      start voting on governance matters.

      The funding for the OP economy comes from the ownership of OP Mainnet and
      the value of its blockspace. Currently, funding is obtained through the
      centralized sequencer, which is then redistributed by The Optimism
      Foundation. However, in the future, funding can be obtained by selling the
      right to participate in Optimism's decentralized sequencing network. This
      sustainable revenue source ensures the growth and sustainability of the OP
      economic model.


      Many markets fail to adequately fund and support public goods. Optimism
      addresses this issue by integrating a sustainable funding source into the
      network itself. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) plays a
      crucial role in distributing sequencer revenue back to the ecosystem. This
      incentivizes individuals to contribute to the public good of the Optimism
      Collective. The Citizens' House, through voting, determines the
      distribution of funds to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that
      have made a positive impact.


      The Foundation expects RetroPGF to drive a wide range of downstream
      effects, benefiting the entire Optimism Collective. This mechanism not
      only funds public goods but also provides exit liquidity for early
      investment in these projects. The governance structure of the Foundation
      ensures efficient and effective allocation of public goods funding,
      drawing inspiration from the work of Ostrom and Vitalik. By creating
      conditions for experimentation, the Foundation aims to maximize the
      long-term value for builders, users, tokenholders, citizens, and the
      entire Optimism Collective.


      The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that a healthy ecosystem is
      built on robust public goods. The economics of this ecosystem are designed
      to generate value for three key groups: tokenholders, contributors and
      builders, and users and community members:


      ### Tokenholders

      Tokenholders benefit from the productive re-deployment of sequencer
      revenue. This revenue is primarily directed towards funding public goods,
      which not only creates value for the ecosystem but also drives demand for
      blockspace. As the network grows, the value of tokenholder investments
      increases.


      ### Contributors & Builders

      Contributors and builders play a crucial role in the Optimism Collective.
      They receive direct benefits from retroactive public goods funding and the
      markets it enables. Additionally, they benefit from a well-funded
      ecosystem that provides them with the necessary tools, education, apps,
      and infrastructure to build and thrive.


      ### Users & Community Members

      Users and community members also reap the rewards of the OP ecosystem.
      They receive ongoing airdrops of OP tokens, project incentives made
      possible by OP ecosystem funding, and the overall benefits that public
      goods provide. This creates a symbiotic relationship where the community
      members contribute to the ecosystem's growth and, in turn, benefit from
      its success.

      ### Ecosystem Fund


      The Ecosystem Fund is an incentive program designed to stimulate the
      development of the Collective ecosystem. This fund will directly support
      the communities and companies that drive the expansion of the Collective
      ecosystem, known as OPCOs. The allocation dedicated to the Ecosystem Fund
      will be further divided into different categories. It is important to
      mention that the Ecosystem Fund is intended to be a kick-starting
      mechanism that will eventually be phased out once the OP in the fund has
      been depleted.


      ### Airdrops


      The Optimism Foundation aims to reward and attract users from both the
      Optimism and Ethereum communities through the distribution of OP tokens.
      This distribution will occur in multiple waves, with the first wave being
      Airdrop #1. Airdrop #1 was designed to cast a wide net and distribute OP
      to over 250k addresses. To ensure fairness, the eligibility criteria for
      this airdrop can be found in the Airdrop #1 documentation. Additionally,
      14% of the OP token supply will be reserved for future user airdrops.


      ### RetroPGF


      An allocation of 8.8% of the OP token supply will be held in reserve for
      future programs, to be determined by the Foundation and/or the governance
      community. Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) will be distributed
      by the Citizens' House, with rounds expected to occur quarterly. The
      objective of RetroPGF is to ensure that all OPCOs are adequately rewarded
      based on their impact to the Collective. The Optimism Foundation may tap
      into the 20% RetroPGF Reserve to increase the total OP payout of any given
      period.


      ### Core Contributors & Sugar Xaddies


      The Core Contributors allocation will be distributed to the individuals
      who played a crucial role in bringing Optimism and the Optimism Collective
      from concept to reality. These tokens will also continue to support the
      development of the protocol. Both the Core Contributors and Sugar Xaddies
      allocations will be subject to a lockup period.

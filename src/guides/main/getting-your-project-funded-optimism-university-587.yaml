      ### Grants Council


      The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
      role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
      initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
      Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):


      **Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including
      developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
      Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align
      with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing
      proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the
      project contributes to this mission.


      **Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel
      applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
      these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of
      the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
      designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
      the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.


      **Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the
      grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism
      ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that
      address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements
      for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals
      will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated
      periodically.


      The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles
      to process applications. It is important to refer to the governance
      calendar for the schedule and deadlines. Additionally, for a better
      understanding of the types of grants the Council aims to provide, one can
      refer to the upcoming Requests for Grants, which will provide more
      detailed information.



      The following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:

      ### Token House Missions


      The Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting
      on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align
      with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a
      Mission under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under
      Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the
      Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season,
      which is roughly every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has
      suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents.
      Let's explore the different Intents and their proposed budgets:

      </div>



      One can apply by submitting a Mission proposal on the forum requesting the
      grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will
      be approval ranked by the Token House every six months.

      ### Foundation Missions

      Foundation Missions are projects that the Optimism Foundation wants to
      undertake to further their goals. These missions are pre-specified by the
      foundation and are designed to address specific challenges or
      opportunities. They are supported by the Partner Fund, which means that
      the funding for these missions comes from external sources and not from
      the Governance Fund. The foundation carefully selects which proposals will
      be chosen to complete each mission, ensuring that they align with their
      vision and objectives.


      The following are the types of Collective Trust Tiers which are the very
      first step towards establishing a connection between oneâ€™s positive impact
      in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles
      within the Collective:

      </div>



      If you are interested in contributing to a Foundation Mission, you can
      find an open mission on the list provided by the Optimism Foundation. Each
      mission will have a specified submission and selection deadline, so make
      sure to take note of these dates. To apply, you can simply reply as a
      comment on the RFP's Github Issue, providing your application and any
      relevant information. While the Token House, a governing body, does not
      vote on Foundation Missions, they have visibility into all RFP
      applications, ensuring transparency and accountability.


      ### Partner Fund


      The Partner Fund, managed by the Optimism Foundation, is a grants program
      aimed at providing strategic and larger scale grants to partners who have
      already achieved product market fit. The primary objective of the Partner
      Fund is to foster the growth of Optimism's ecosystem for the benefit of
      the entire Collective.


      The Partner Fund primarily focuses on projects that have already
      demonstrated success in the crypto space and are now looking to deploy and
      scale on the Optimism platform. These projects can be related to various
      areas of work, including Defi, NFTs, DAOs, and large scale usage growth
      for the ecosystem. By supporting these projects, the Partner Fund aims to
      build a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.


      The structure of the grants falls under these two categories:


      **User Incentives:** Grants provided by the fund are directly distributed
      to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem. This can be in the form
      of liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives. By directly
      involving the users, the Partner Fund ensures that the grants have a
      meaningful impact on the growth and adoption of the projects.


      **Project Grants:** Projects that receive a grant from the Partner Fund,
      there is a 1-year token lockup period. This means that the granted tokens
      cannot be immediately sold or transferred. Instead, they can be used to
      support the operational costs of the project. This lockup period ensures
      that the granted tokens are utilized in a way that aligns with the
      long-term objectives of the Optimism ecosystem.


      It's important to note that the Optimism Foundation receives a large
      number of applications for the Partner Fund and can only support a select
      few that align with its objectives. However, for those who have applied to
      the Governance Fund and were not reviewed or accepted, there is an
      opportunity to fill out a form for a new inquiry. This allows individuals
      or projects who did not apply through the Governance Fund to still be
      considered for the Partner Fund grants.

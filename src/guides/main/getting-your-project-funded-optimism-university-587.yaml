      ### Grants Council


      The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
      role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
      initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
      Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):


      **Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including
      developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
      Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align
      with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing
      proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the
      project contributes to this mission.


      **Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel
      applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
      these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of
      the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
      designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
      the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.


      **Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the
      grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism
      ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that
      address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements
      for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals
      will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated
      periodically.


      The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles
      to process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance
      calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
      for the schedule and deadlines. 



      The following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:

      </div>



      ### Token House Missions


      The Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting
      on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align
      with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a
      Mission under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under
      Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the
      Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season,
      which is roughly every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has
      suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents.
      Let's explore the different Intents and their proposed budgets:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695320088654_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png"/>
      </div>



      One can apply by submitting a [Mission
      proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the
      forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier.
      Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six
      months.

      ### Foundation Missions

      Foundation Missions are projects that the Optimism Foundation wants to
      undertake to further their goals. These missions are pre-specified by the
      foundation and are designed to address specific challenges or
      opportunities. They are supported by the Partner Fund, which means that
      the funding for these missions comes from external sources and not from
      the Governance Fund. The foundation carefully selects which proposals will
      be chosen to complete each mission, ensuring that they align with their
      vision and objectives.


      The following are the types of Collective Trust Tiers which are the very
      first step towards establishing a connection between oneâ€™s positive impact
      in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles
      within the Collective:



      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695644644531_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>



      If you are interested in contributing to a Foundation Mission, you can
      find an open mission on the list provided by the Optimism Foundation. Each
      mission will have a specified submission and selection deadline, so make
      sure to take note of these dates. To apply, you can simply reply as a
      comment on the [RFP's Github
      Issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP),
      providing your application and any relevant information. While the Token
      House, a governing body, does not vote on Foundation Missions, they have
      visibility into all RFP applications, ensuring transparency and
      accountability.


      ### Partner Fund


      The Partner Fund, managed by the Optimism Foundation, is a grants program
      aimed at providing strategic and larger scale grants to partners who have
      already achieved product market fit. The primary objective of the Partner
      Fund is to foster the growth of Optimism's ecosystem for the benefit of
      the entire Collective.


      The Partner Fund primarily focuses on projects that have already
      demonstrated success in the crypto space and are now looking to deploy and
      scale on the Optimism platform. These projects can be related to various
      areas of work, including Defi, NFTs, DAOs, and large scale usage growth
      for the ecosystem. By supporting these projects, the Partner Fund aims to
      build a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.


      The structure of the grants falls under these two categories:


      **User Incentives:** Grants provided by the fund are directly distributed
      to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem. This can be in the form
      of liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives. By directly
      involving the users, the Partner Fund ensures that the grants have a
      meaningful impact on the growth and adoption of the projects.


      **Project Grants:** Projects that receive a grant from the Partner Fund,
      there is a 1-year token lockup period. This means that the granted tokens
      cannot be immediately sold or transferred. Instead, they can be used to
      support the operational costs of the project. This lockup period ensures
      that the granted tokens are utilized in a way that aligns with the
      long-term objectives of the Optimism ecosystem.


      It's important to note that the Optimism Foundation receives a large
      number of applications for the Partner Fund and can only support a select
      few that align with its objectives. Anyone can apply by simply filling out
      the [form](https://airtable.com/shrvQNlFPHGcVNqDe?prefill_Referrer=OPGov).
      There are no deadlines, applications are processed on a rolling basis

      ### Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF)


      Retroactive PGF (RetroPGF) is a program that rewards work that has already
      been completed for its positive impact. It is administered by the
      Citizens' House, which decides on the allocation of rewards based on the
      assessment of each project's contribution to the Collective. If you are
      working on a project aligned with the Collective and are comfortable with
      less upfront certainty regarding scope, reward amount, and timing, you may
      be eligible for RetroPGF rewards.


      RetroPGF is open to all contributors in the Optimism ecosystem, including
      artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists. Whether you are a
      developer working on an Ethereum execution client or an educator creating
      Optimism-inspired video content, as long as your work has made an impact,
      you are eligible to apply. 


      There are four categories in which your work can make an impact and be
      considered for RetroPGF rewards:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695644869646_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>


      **OP Stack:** The first category is OP Stack, which includes work that
      enhances the efficiency, security, resilience, and awareness of the OP
      Stack. 


      **Collective Governance:** The second category is Collective Governance,
      which encompasses work that provides impact to governance participants of
      the Optimism Collective or helps bring new participants into the
      Collective.


      **Developer Ecosystem:** The third category is Developer Ecosystem, which
      focuses on work that provides impact to application developers in the
      Optimism Collective or helps attract new developers to the Collective. 


      **End User Experience & Adoption:** The fourth category is End User
      Experience & Adoption, which recognizes work that provides impact to end
      users in the Optimism Collective or helps bring new users into the
      Collective.


      [Project applications](http://app.optimism.io/retropgf-signup) will be
      accepted from September 19th to October 23rd 2023. Applicants will
      typically have to provide detailed information about their projects.
      Following the project application period, a voting phase will take place.
      The voting period starts from November 6th to December 7th 2023. Voting
      badges have been offered to 208 community members. After the voting phase
      will conclude, the results of the selected projects will be determined.
      Starting in early January, the process of disbursing tokens or funding to
      the chosen projects will begin.

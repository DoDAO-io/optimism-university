      ### Grants Council


      The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
      role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
      initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
      Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):


      **Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including
      developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
      Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align
      with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing
      proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the
      project contributes to this mission.


      **Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel
      applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
      these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of
      the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
      designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
      the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.


      **Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the
      grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism
      ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that
      address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements
      for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals
      will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated
      periodically.


      The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles
      to process applications. It is important to refer to the governance
      calendar for the schedule and deadlines. Additionally, for a better
      understanding of the types of grants the Council aims to provide, one can
      refer to the upcoming Requests for Grants, which will provide more
      detailed information.

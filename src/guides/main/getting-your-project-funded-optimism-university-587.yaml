      Collective Grants are a type of funding that supports specific projects to
      be completed in the future. These grants are made in OP (Optimism) and are
      subject to the Collective Grant Policies. There are two main sources of
      Collective Grants: Mission Grants and Foundation Funds.


      # Mission Grants


      Mission Grants are grants that align with the Collective Intents and are
      specified initiatives that can be completed within 12 months. Each Mission
      Request has a bounty of OP attached to it. The Foundation and the Top 100
      Token House Delegates have the authority to issue Mission Requests. Any
      team can submit a Mission Application to fulfill a Request. To apply for a
      Mission Grant, you can find an open Mission Request on the list provided
      and submit your application via the specified link or directly as a
      comment on the Github Issue. The Grants Council, with the help of the
      Developer Advisory Board, evaluates and selects Delegate Mission
      Applications, while the Optimism Foundation evaluates and selects
      Foundation Mission Requests.


      These are the Collective Intents for the 5th Season:

      </div>


      The following are the types of Collective Trust Tiers which are the very
      first step towards establishing a connection between oneâ€™s positive impact
      in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles
      within the Collective:

      # Foundation Funds

      </div>


      Foundation Funds are another source of Collective Grants. The Foundation
      may make grants from the Partner or Seed Fund on a case-by-case basis. The
      Seed Fund is used to support projects or teams that are starting from
      scratch and are focused on building Optimism. On the other hand, the
      Partner Fund is used to provide tools to the Optimism community, bring
      applications to OP Mainnet, promote education, experiment with liquidity
      mining programs, drive consumer usage, and support Optimism's governance
      system.

      # Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF)


      Retroactive PGF (RetroPGF) is a program that rewards work that has already
      been completed for its positive impact. It is administered by the
      Citizens' House, which decides on the allocation of rewards based on the
      assessment of each project's contribution to the Collective. If you are
      working on a project aligned with the Collective and are comfortable with
      less upfront certainty regarding scope, reward amount, and timing, you may
      be eligible for RetroPGF rewards.


      RetroPGF is open to all contributors in the Optimism ecosystem, including
      artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists. Whether you are a
      developer working on an Ethereum execution client or an educator creating
      Optimism-inspired video content, as long as your work has made an impact,
      you are eligible to apply. 


      There were four categories in Round 3 in which your work could be
      considered for RetroPGF rewards:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1696856222175_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png"/>
      </div>


      **OP Stack:** The first category is OP Stack, which includes work that
      enhances the efficiency, security, resilience, and awareness of the OP
      Stack. 


      **Collective Governance:** The second category is Collective Governance,
      which encompasses work that provides impact to governance participants of
      the Optimism Collective or helps bring new participants into the
      Collective.


      **Developer Ecosystem:** The third category is Developer Ecosystem, which
      focuses on work that provides impact to application developers in the
      Optimism Collective or helps attract new developers to the Collective. 


      **End User Experience & Adoption:** The fourth category is End User
      Experience & Adoption, which recognizes work that provides impact to end
      users in the Optimism Collective or helps bring new users into the
      Collective.


      Voting badges were offered to 146 badgeholders. After the voting phase
      will conclude, the results of the selected projects were determined by
      January.

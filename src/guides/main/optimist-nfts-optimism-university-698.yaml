      The world of NFTs has seen a surge in popularity, and Optimism is no
      exception. Optimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, and it has
      its own unique NFT ecosystem. Let's explore some of the top NFT projects
      on Optimism and how they contribute to the overall ecosystem:



      ### PFP Collections

      In the early days of Optimism's development, PFP (Profile Picture)
      collections were all the rage. One such project is the [Optimism Ape Yacht
      Club](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Foayc.io%2F&psig=AOvVaw2zxeqmmg_KgqjEVPEV7bl6&ust=1695907025631000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjhxqFwoTCNiJiJbwyoEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAP)
      (OAYC), which holds the title for the most traded project on Optimism.
      However, there are also original PFP collections like
      [Apetimism](https://apetimism.com/), although it accounts for smaller
      trading volumes.


      ### Velodrome Governance NFTs

      [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/) Governance NFTs have become a
      ruling force in the Optimism NFT scene. These NFTs come with privileges in
      Velodrome Tokenomics, such as rebases that prevent voting power dilution.
      To obtain Velodrome NFTs, you can either lock $VELO tokens on their
      website or purchase them on secondary markets like Opensea.

      ### Optimism Quests NFTs

      [Optimism Quests](https://app.optimism.io/quests) NFTs have a different
      purpose. They aim to educate new users in the Optimism ecosystem. Season 1
      of Optimism Quests involved 18 third-party apps on Optimism, and Season 2
      is expected to take place in 2023. An interesting detail is that Optimism
      Quest NFTs can alter traits on "Optimist NFTs," a PFP collection by the
      Optimism team. 


      ### Mirror Writing NFTs

      [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is a Web3 native blogging platform that has
      made its mark in the Optimism ecosystem with its Writing NFTs. These NFTs
      allow readers to collect blog post-related NFTs and support writers. It
      provides an opportunity for writers to monetize their work and build a
      community that genuinely supports their journey. The Mirror team saw the
      launch of Optimism as an opportunity to make collecting blog posts cheap
      and efficient through Writing NFTs.

      [Optimist NFTs](https://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft) are digital avatars
      that allow individuals to express their personality and build their
      onchain identity. These NFTs are fully customizable, enabling users to
      create a one-of-a-kind avatar that represents their unique interests and
      traits. The vision behind Optimist NFTs is to reflect the identity and
      reputation of individuals as they interact with various projects and
      protocols. Currently in Beta, these NFTs are available for minting to
      voters in RetroPGF 2. However, the plan is to make them widely accessible
      to the entire crypto community as the Optimism Collective grows.

      ### Unique Avatar

      With Optimist NFTs, users have the power to design an avatar that truly
      reflects their individuality. These avatars can be customized to showcase
      personal style, interests, and traits. By creating a visually appealing
      and unique avatar, individuals can establish their presence in the
      Optimism ecosystem and build their reputation. The Optimist NFTs act as a
      representation of an individual Optimist, evolving alongside their
      identity and reputation as they engage with different projects and
      protocols.


      ### Minting and Availability

      The minting of Optimist NFTs was limited to voters in RetroPGF 2
      previously. However, starting from 2023, several hundred active addresses
      have been invited to mint each month based on their participation in the
      Optimism Collective and data recorded in the AttestationStation.The
      ultimate goal is to make Optimist NFTs widely available for customization
      and minting as the Optimism Collective expands.


      ### Unlocking New Traits

      As the Optimism ecosystem grows, new traits will be unlocked based on an
      individual's participation. This means that the more actively someone
      engages with the Optimism ecosystem, the more unique traits they can
      unlock for their Optimist NFT. This incentivizes users to actively
      participate and contribute to the growth of the Optimism Collective,
      allowing them to further personalize their avatars and showcase their
      achievements within the ecosystem.

      RetroPGF Round 3 is an event that aims to reward individuals and projects
      that have contributed to the development and adoption of Optimism, a
      technology platform. 


      In this round, a total of 30 million OP tokens will be allocated to reward
      these contributions. Whether you have built a consumer app, provided
      essential infrastructure, or created a community tool that Optimism users
      appreciate, you are eligible to apply for this reward.


      The application process for RetroPGF Round 3 is crucial, and it is
      recommended to take your time and start early. The application will be
      used by 208 badgeholders, who are individuals with a certain level of
      authority and expertise, to evaluate the impact your project has had on
      the Optimism Collective. Based on this evaluation, they will determine the
      amount of OP tokens you should receive as a reward.


      It is important to note that the rules of RetroPGF Round 3 must be
      followed. If your application is reported for violating these rules,
      badgeholders have the authority to remove your project from being eligible
      for the rewards. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that your
      application complies with the guidelines and regulations set forth by
      RetroPGF.


      This event is a great opportunity for individuals and projects that have
      contributed to the development and adoption of Optimism to be recognized
      and rewarded for their efforts. By participating in RetroPGF Round 3, you
      have the chance to receive OP tokens as a token of appreciation for the
      impact you have made on the Optimism Collective. So, make sure to fill out
      your application diligently and adhere to the rules to increase your
      chances of being eligible for the rewards.

      In the Optimism ecosystem, there are various types of contributors who are
      eligible for RetroPGF, a program that rewards impactful work. Whether you
      are a developer working on an Ethereum execution client or an educator
      creating Optimism-inspired video content, as long as you are making a
      positive impact, you are eligible to participate in RetroPGF.


      RetroPGF Round 3 is open to all Optimism artists, creators, writers,
      builders, and evangelists. It doesn't matter what role you play in the
      ecosystem; if your work has made an impact in any of the four categories,
      you should consider submitting an application for RetroPGF.


      ### Impact Categories


      The RetroPGF program is structured around four categories, each
      representing a different aspect of the Optimism ecosystem:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retropgf_round_3_optimism_university_471/1695647253565_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>


      **OP Stack:** This category focuses on work that enhances the efficiency,
      security, resilience, and awareness of the OP Stack. If your contribution
      has improved any of these aspects, you should consider selecting this
      category.


      **Collective Governance:** If your work has provided impact to governance
      participants of the Optimism Collective or has helped bring new
      participants into the Collective, this is the category for you. It
      recognizes the efforts made towards strengthening the governance structure
      of Optimism.


      **Developer Ecosystem:** This category acknowledges work that has provided
      impact to application developers in the Optimism Collective or has helped
      bring new developers into the Collective. If your contribution has made a
      difference in this area, you should consider selecting this category.


      **End User Experience & Adoption:** The final category focuses on work
      that has provided impact to end users in the Optimism Collective or has
      helped bring new users into the Collective. If your work has improved the
      experience of end users or has contributed to the adoption of Optimism,
      this category is relevant to you.


      While you can select multiple categories, it is recommended to choose the
      ones that best describe the impact of your work. RetroPGF rewards will be
      allocated based on the assessment of your individual profile, so it is
      important to select the categories that align with your contributions. It
      is worth noting that selecting all categories will not give you an
      advantage in the evaluation process.

      When applying for Optimism Contributions, it is important to follow the
      guidelines provided to ensure your application is considered. These
      guidelines are designed to help badgeholders understand the impact of your
      contributions and determine the appropriate RetroPGF amount. The following
      are the key points one should keep in mind when submitting their
      application:


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retropgf_round_3_optimism_university_471/1695647209212_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Key Details First

      To capture the attention of badgeholders, it is crucial to provide the
      most important information in the first few sentences of your application.
      This will help them quickly understand the nature of your work and its
      relevance to Optimism. Avoid making promises or alluding to future plans,
      as this may lead to disqualification.


      ### Highlight the Impact

      It is crucial to be specific about the impact your contributions have on
      Optimism. Describe how your work benefits the Collective and who
      specifically benefits from it. Whether it's a consumer app, an
      infrastructure project, or a community tool, emphasize the positive
      outcomes and the value it brings to Optimism. By clearly articulating the
      impact, you can demonstrate the significance of your contributions. Make
      sure to add links to resources that showcase your work.


      ### Impact Metrics

      To further demonstrate the value of your contributions, consider including
      impact metrics. These can be quantitative or qualitative measurements that
      highlight the impact of your work. Think about the metrics that best
      showcase how your contributions have supported the development and
      adoption of Optimism. Ensure that these metrics are verifiable by
      including links to data sources that badgeholders can use to verify them.
      If you are choosing a category for your application, make sure to connect
      your impact description and metrics to the success metrics of that
      category. This will help badgeholders understand how your contributions
      have driven towards the overall success of Optimism. 


      ### Grants & Funding

      Badgeholders need to understand the financial support you have already
      received for your contributions. Provide accurate information about grants
      or revenue directly related to the contributions you are seeking RetroPGF
      for. This information will help determine the appropriate amount of
      RetroPGF for your work. You do not need to include VC funding or other
      investments in your project or person.

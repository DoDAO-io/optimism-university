      ### What is Optimism?


      Optimism is a layer 2 chain that operates on top of the Ethereum mainnet,
      also known as layer 1. This means that transactions occur on the Optimism
      chain, but the transaction data is posted and validated on the Ethereum
      mainnet. To put it simply, it's like driving on a less crowded side street
      while still benefiting from the security of a highway.


      ### What is Layer-2?


      Layer-2 (L2) is a secondary layer built on top of a main blockchain
      (Layer-1 or L1) to improve its speed and scalability. It helps process
      transactions faster and reduce congestion on the main blockchain. Examples
      include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Optimistic Rollups for
      Ethereum.


      ### Why do we need Layer-2?


      Layer-2 solutions are essential because they tackle the inherent
      limitations of Layer-1 blockchains. Main blockchains like Ethereum and
      Bitcoin often struggle with slow transaction processing and high fees when
      they become congested due to increased user activity. This congestion
      hinders their ability to scale and support a growing user base
      effectively.


      Layer-2 solutions provide a crucial remedy by offloading a portion of the
      transaction load onto secondary layers. These secondary layers, while
      independently operated, remain secured by the primary blockchain's
      consensus mechanisms. As a result, Layer-2 solutions significantly enhance
      transaction speeds, reduce costs, and increase the overall capacity of
      blockchain networks. They make blockchain technology more practical for a
      wide range of applications, from everyday transactions to decentralized
      applications (dApps) and smart contracts.


      ### Roll-ups


      Rollup is a type of layer two solution to solve the Ethereum scalability
      problem. Roll ups work by executing transactions outside the main ethereum
      chain, while submitting data to the base chain.This means that layer-2
      networks can handle the processing of transactions much faster than the
      base blockchain, since there is a smaller validator set with better
      hardware. In addition, the base blockchain only needs to execute proofs
      submitted to the rollup smart contract to verify the activity on the
      layer-2 network, rather than store raw, unexecuted transaction data. There
      are generally two main kinds of roll-ups:

      </div>



      #### a. Optimistic Rollups


      Optimism is categorized as an "Optimistic Rollup," which is essentially a
      blockchain that relies on the security of another blockchain, known as the
      parent chain. In this case, Optimism leverages the consensus mechanism,
      such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), of the Ethereum
      mainnet. By doing so, Optimism can benefit from the robust security
      measures already in place on the parent chain, ensuring the safety and
      integrity of transactions on the Optimism chain.


      #### b. Zero-Knowledge Rollups


      Unlike Optimistic rollups, ZK rollups use cryptographic proofs like SNARKs
      or STARKs to confirm transactions' authenticity, making them more
      efficient as they update Layer 2 state through these proofs. This approach
      simplifies block validation and ETH transfers to Layer 1. However, ZK
      rollups may not fully support EVM and may be resource-intensive for low
      on-chain activity applications.

      Optimism is a type of blockchain called an "Optimistic Rollup." It works
      by leveraging the security of another blockchain, known as the parent
      chain. Instead of having its own consensus mechanism, Optimistic Rollups
      rely on the consensus mechanism of the parent chain, such as Proof of Work
      (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). The following is a brief explanation of the
      fundamental principles of this concept:


      ### Block Storage


      In the case of Optimism, L2 blocks are stored on the Ethereum blockchain
      using a non-contract address. This helps minimize the gas expenses on the
      Ethereum network. Once these blocks are submitted as transaction calldata
      on Ethereum, they cannot be modified or censored. This ensures the
      availability and integrity guarantees of Ethereum are inherited by the
      Optimism network.

      </div>


      ### Block Production


      Optimism block production is primarily managed by a single party called
      the "sequencer." The sequencer provides various services to the network.
      In Bedrock, the sequencer has a private mempool, similar to Ethereum's L1,
      to prevent opportunities for MEV (Miner Extractable Value). Blocks are
      produced every two seconds on OP Mainnet, regardless of whether they are
      empty or filled with transactions.


      Transactions submitted on the Ethereum L1, known as deposits, are included
      in the appropriate L2 block. Each L2 block is identified by its epoch (the
      corresponding L1 block) and a serial number within that epoch. The first
      block of the epoch includes all the deposits that occurred in the
      corresponding L1 block. If the sequencer tries to ignore a legitimate L1
      transaction, it will result in an inconsistent state with the verifiers.


      ### Block Execution


      The execution engine, implemented as the op-geth component, receives
      blocks using two mechanisms. It can update itself using a peer-to-peer
      network with other execution engines, similar to how L1 execution clients
      synchronize the state across the network. The rollup node, implemented as
      the op-node component, derives the L2 blocks from the L1 blockchain.

      Optimism's design is closely aligned with the Ethereum vision, aiming to
      create an optimistic future for the Ethereum ecosystem. The design
      philosophy of Optimism is built on the following pillars:


      ### Simplicity

      The design philosophy of Optimism revolves around simplicity. The goal is
      to create a system that is as simple as possible while providing the
      necessary features. By minimizing the number of moving parts, Optimism
      gains significant advantages over more complex Layer 2 constructions. This
      simplicity reduces engineering overhead, allowing the team to focus on
      developing new features instead of recreating existing ones. It also
      enhances security by reducing the potential for unintentional bugs and
      makes the codebase more accessible to external contributors and auditors.

      </div>


      ### Pragmatism

      The design process of Optimism is driven by pragmatism. The team
      acknowledges real-world constraints, the needs of projects built on
      Optimism, and the problems faced by users. The philosophy prioritizes user
      and developer needs over theoretical perfection. The development of
      Optimism is iterative, with continuous feedback from users playing a
      crucial role in shaping the protocol. This approach has enabled the
      implementation of features like EVM Equivalence, which were made possible
      through user input and iterative development.


      ### Sustainability

      Optimism's design philosophy emphasizes long-term sustainability. The team
      recognizes that a scalable system is meaningless without a sustainable
      ecosystem to support it. To ensure long-term sustainability, Optimism's
      protocol design aligns with the philosophy of simplicity. By keeping the
      codebase simple, Optimism can build a larger community of contributors who
      can help maintain the protocol over time. Sustainability is a key
      consideration in the design process, as shortcuts to scalability are
      avoided in favor of a robust and enduring system.

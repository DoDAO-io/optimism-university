      ### What is Citizen House?


      The Citizens' House is an innovative approach to governance that aims to
      promote fairness and inclusivity. It is a part of the Optimism Collective,
      working alongside the Token House to govern the collective. In its initial
      stage, the Citizens' House is responsible for voting on the allocation of
      Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF). This funding is used to
      support public goods that have already been provided.


      During this early phase, the Optimism Foundation takes charge of
      determining the scope and amount of each funding round. They also oversee
      the voting process. It's important to note that holding a voting badge
      during this stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the
      Citizens' House or future rounds of RetroPGF.

      ### Role & Responsibilities


      **Collaboration with Token House:** The Citizens' House collaborates with
      the Token House to make decisions regarding the allocation of surplus
      protocol revenue. This collaboration ensures a balanced governance system.


      **Defining Participation Criteria:** The Citizens' House plays a role in
      defining the criteria for participation in the governance process,
      ensuring that those involved meet certain requirements or standards.


      **Enforcement of Codes of Conduct:** It ensures adherence to the
      Collective's Codes of Conduct, helping maintain a respectful and ethical
      environment within the governance system.


      **RetroPGF Rounds:** The Citizens' House is closely associated with
      RetroPGF rounds, which follow a predefined process involving phases such
      as scoping, nominations, profile creation, voting, and disbursements.


      **KYC Procedures:** The Foundation performs Know Your Customer (KYC)
      procedures as part of the grant distribution process, ensuring
      transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

      ### How to Become a Citizen?


      Becoming a citizen is an important process that involves being recognized
      as a member of a particular community or country. In the context of the
      Citizens' House, citizenship is based on identity and aligning with the
      values of the Collective. This is different from the more common practice
      of token-voting governance. 


      To start the process of becoming a citizen in the Citizens' House,
      participants are given temporary badges that allow them to vote in
      RetroPGF rounds. These rounds serve as a way for individuals to have a say
      in the decision-making process of the Collective. However, holding a
      voting badge does not guarantee permanent citizenship, as membership is
      determined by governance and may change over time. 


      The Citizens' House works in collaboration with the Token House to
      establish criteria for participation in the Citizens' House. This means
      that the requirements for citizenship may evolve and be determined by the
      collective governance of the community. The AttestationStation contract
      plays a crucial role in this process, as it is a neutral and
      permissionless contract that is used to determine the set of citizens
      based on reputation data.


      ### Number of Citizens


      The number of citizens responsible for voting keeps on increasing in every
      RetroPGF round as depicted in the diagram below:

      </div>


      ### Citizenship - Now & Future


      The current phase of Citizens' House governance is seeing an increase in
      the number of voting badges with each round of RetroPGF. This shows that
      the community is growing and more individuals are being given the
      opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. However, it is
      important to note that voting in a specific round does not guarantee
      permanent participation in the Citizens' House or future iterations of
      RetroPGF.


      In the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across
      the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various
      subcultures and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens
      and contribute their expertise to the community. However, it is also
      important to recognize that the criteria for citizenship may change as the
      governance of the community evolves.

      ### Retroactive Public Goods Funding


      RetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for
      public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP
      Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive
      impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their
      contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the
      public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves. 


      The funding provided through RetroPGF is given to projects, companies,
      communities, or other entities that have already proven their value to the
      Optimism ecosystem. This approach is taken because it is easier to
      identify projects that have been useful in the past, rather than
      predicting their future usefulness. By rewarding projects that have
      already demonstrated their usefulness, RetroPGF ensures better capital
      allocation and encourages the development of public goods that have a
      tangible impact.

      ### RetroPGF Round 1


      The Optimism Collective conducted its first round of Retroactive Public
      Goods Funding (RetroPGF) in the fourth quarter of 2021. This round aimed
      to allocate $1 million to fund projects that have provided value to the
      Optimistic Ethereum ecosystem. A total of 76 projects were nominated, and
      58 of them received funding from the badgeholders. The median funding
      received by a project in RetroPGF 1 was $14,670, while the top 10% of
      projects received more than $36,919.


      The process for RetroPGF Round 1 involved two main stages: badgeholder
      selection and voting. In this round, 24 badgeholders, consisting of 8
      Optimists and 16 Ethereum community members, were chosen to vote on
      distributing retrofunding to the nominated projects. Anyone could nominate
      a project during the nomination period by providing the project name,
      project lead name, project lead email, and impact description. The
      badgeholders were then provided with a manual and asked to evaluate and
      vote on the nominated projects.


      ### RetroPGF Round 2


      The Optimism Collective's second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding
      took place in the first quarter of 2023. This time, RetroPGF 2 allocated
      10 million OP tokens to fund public goods that support the development and
      usage of the OP Stack. The goal of RetroPGF is to build a global system
      where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the
      individual. In this round, all 195 nominated people and projects were
      awarded funding by the badgeholders.


      The badgeholders played a crucial role in distributing the OP tokens to
      the projects. For RetroPGF Round 2, badgeholders were selected based on
      their participation in the previous round, through nomination by
      Optimism's Token House, and by nomination from other badgeholders. The
      nomination period allowed anyone to nominate a project by providing its
      name, impact description, and a link to Github/Twitter. Projects then had
      to create a profile with general information and a description of their
      project and its impact.


      ### RetroPGF Round 3


      The third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding, RetroPGF 3 has
      commenced in the fall of 2023. This round will allocate 30 million OP
      tokens to reward contributions that have supported the development and
      adoption of Optimism. RetroPGF is open to all types of contributors to the
      Optimism ecosystem, including developers, educators, artists, creators,
      writers, builders, and evangelists.


      To be eligible for RetroPGF, your work should have made an impact in one
      of the four categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer
      Ecosystem, and End User Experience & Adoption. Whether you have enhanced
      the efficiency and security of the OP Stack, provided impact to governance
      participants or application developers, or contributed to the end user
      experience and adoption, you can submit an application for RetroPGF.
      Voting badges for Round 3 have been distributed to 208 community members. 


      RetroPGF aims to fund projects that contribute to the growth and success
      of the Optimism ecosystem, creating a rich ecosystem and a better economy
      for all.

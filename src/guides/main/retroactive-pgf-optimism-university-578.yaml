      ### What is RetroPGF?


      RetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for
      public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP
      Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive
      impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their
      contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the
      public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves.

      ### Benefits of RetroPGF


      **Exit Liquidity for Public Goods Projects:** RetroPGF creates a market
      for early investment in public goods projects, offering them an exit
      liquidity option. This allows projects to raise capital and grow based on
      their early potential and contributions.


      **Encouragement of Innovation:** By compensating projects for their
      positive contributions, RetroPGF incentivizes innovation and funding in
      the development of public goods on Optimism.


      **Rewarding Proven Value:** RetroPGF allocates funding to projects,
      companies, communities, or entities that have demonstrated their value to
      the Optimism ecosystem in the past. This approach prioritizes projects
      with a track record of usefulness, ensuring more effective capital
      allocation.


      **Profit-Motive Integration:** RetroPGF introduces financial incentives
      similar to those in Silicon Valley, attracting speculators and early
      investors seeking financial gains. Builders have the opportunity to raise
      capital and bootstrap their projects, fostering increased innovation and
      development within the Optimism ecosystem.

      RetroPGF, or Retroactive Public Goods Funding, is a mechanism used by the
      Optimism Collective to reward entities and projects in the ecosystem that
      have already provided a public good. The goal is to create a financial
      incentive for building public goods that benefit the ecosystem as a whole,
      even if there is no direct monetization model. This helps to foster a more
      diverse ecosystem of goods and services on the Optimism chain.


      ### How RetroPGF Works?


      The way RetroPGF works is that the revenue generated by the sequencer,
      which is responsible for submitting the optimistic rollup transactions to
      Ethereum, is not retained entirely as profit. Instead, a portion of the
      revenue is distributed back to the Optimism Collective. This revenue is
      then used to fund public goods that have already been provided by entities
      and projects in the ecosystem.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retroactive_pgf_optimism_university_578/1695216009876_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png"/>
      </div>


      The funding is distributed through a governance structure called the
      Citizens' House, which collectively decides on the distribution of funds.
      The Citizens' House votes quarterly on the allocation of funds to
      individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a positive
      impact on the ecosystem. This creates a direct reward for community
      members for their contributions.


      RetroPGF also provides an opportunity for early investment in public goods
      projects, as it offers possible exit liquidity. This means that builders
      can be compensated for their positive contributions without relying solely
      on generating direct revenue. It also allows them to raise capital based
      on the potential and promise of their projects.


      The end result of RetroPGF is a virtuous cycle. As more public goods are
      funded, the ecosystem becomes better, leading to increased demand for
      Optimism blockspace. This, in turn, generates more revenue for the
      sequencer, which can then be used for further retroactive public goods
      funding. This cycle continues to drive the growth and development of the
      ecosystem.

      implementations, making it the most battle-hardened and tested client.
      Geth serves as a gateway into the decentralized web, handling
      transactions, deployment, and execution of smart contracts. By running
      Geth alongside a consensus client, a computer can become an Ethereum node,
      contributing to the network's decentralization.


      ### ETHGlobal


      [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) is a not-for-profit organization that
      aims to foster a world-class ecosystem of Ethereum developers and
      entrepreneurs. Initially funded by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation,
      ETHGlobal is managed as a partnership between L4 and SV Angel.  Through
      their efforts, they aim to create an environment where developers and

      organization (DAO) that acts as the community and incentivization layer
      around scaffold-eth and speedrunethereum.com. Scaffold-ETH provides a base
      for beginners to experiment with Solidity, the programming language used
      for implementing Ethereum-based smart contracts. On the other hand,
      SpeedRunEthereum gamifies the ecosystem through challenges. Developers can
      participate in these challenges together through the BuidlGuidl community,
      fostering collaboration and innovation within the Ethereum space.


      ### Solidity


      [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is an advanced programming language
      specifically designed for implementing Ethereum-based smart contracts. It
      is an object-oriented language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine

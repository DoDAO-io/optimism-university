      ### What is Optimism Collective?


      The Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape
      the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the
      current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the
      economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world.
      However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely
      replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our
      markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of
      these public goods for their impact.


      The Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of
      digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities,
      companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to
      reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves
      as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and
      empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that
      public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive
      incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the
      Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing
      bodies of Optimism Collective:

      ### Mechanism of OP Collective


      By incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective
      propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective
      expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public
      goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the
      digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic
      human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach
      it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become
      commonplace in the future.


      The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and
      profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded
      because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and
      organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the
      Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals
      profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding,
      which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding
      mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful
      and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best
      team to build it.


      Retroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in
      public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit
      payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the
      potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing
      retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and
      communities that are building for the common good and creating a
      sustainable future for Ethereum.

      The Optimism Collective employs an innovative and adaptable approach to
      governance, continually refining its system to ensure its long-term
      viability. The Collective's model of digital democratic governance
      comprises of two chambers: the Token House and the Citizens' House.

      The Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in supporting the
      establishment of the Optimism Collective and the development of the
      Optimism ecosystem. It is part of a larger network of companies, groups,
      and individuals working towards the realization of the Optimistic Vision.
      As an established entity, the Foundation has the ability to enter into
      legally enforceable commitments, allowing it to act quickly and safely to
      support the Collective in its early stages.


      ### Governance

      One of the key responsibilities of the Optimism Foundation is its
      stewardship role in facilitating various administrative aspects of
      Collective governance. It helps develop frameworks such as the Working
      Constitution and the Operating Manual, which are essential for
      facilitating participation within the Collective. By providing these
      administrative services, the Foundation ensures that the Collective
      operates smoothly and efficiently.

      </div>


      ### Support Optimism Protocol

      The Foundation also plays a vital role in supporting the Optimism protocol
      as an open-source project. It encourages and enables the community to
      contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally,
      the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security,
      and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust
      and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the
      Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism
      ecosystem.


      ### Future Goals

      While the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services
      and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating
      the technical and governance foundations that will allow for
      decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of
      empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This
      approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable
      of making independent decisions in the future.

      The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of
      processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a
      closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to
      its smooth functioning:


      ### Governing Body

      The foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently
      consists of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing.
      The board's primary role is to manage the foundation's business and
      affairs. They oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they
      fulfill their legal obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed
      to provide guidance and support to the board.

      </div>


      ### Employment

      To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs
      officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and
      entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and
      responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and
      other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.


      ### Legal Accountability

      As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally
      accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes
      the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism
      Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and
      implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a
      commercially reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is
      limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its
      purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function
      effectively.

  - content: >-
      To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented
      three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect
      the rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the
      organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to
      align its financial resources with the collective's interests and
      priorities:


      ### Vote for Disbursement

      The foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This
      means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are
      determined through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective
      in this decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial
      resources are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and
      priorities of the token holders.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1695645916513_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Director Removal

      The governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's
      Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board
      members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the
      removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or
      acts against the best interests of the foundation. By having this
      authority, the governance ensures that the board members are held to a
      high standard and that their actions are in line with the foundation's
      goals.


      ### Power to Veto

      The Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto
      any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would
      significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves
      as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It
      ensures that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to
      the governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving
      the Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to
      protecting the rights of the token holders.

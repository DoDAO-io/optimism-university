      The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial
      role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various
      initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders,
      Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs).

    content: >-
      Builders grants aim to maximize the number of builders, including
      developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on
      Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align
      with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing
      proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the
      project contributes to this mission.

  - name: Experiments Grants
    uuid: 63137acc-702f-4455-a18c-a5f1a0ea42cc
    content: >-
      Experiments grants are designed to promote the adoption of novel
      applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants,
      these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of
      the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically
      designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of
      the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.

    content: >-
      Requests for Grants (RFGs) represent a transitional moment in the grant
      process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and
      are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most
      pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each
      request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be
      assessed.

    content: >-
      The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles
      to process applications. It is important to refer to the governance
      calendar for the schedule and deadlines.

    content: >-
      The Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting
      on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align
      with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. All proposals under
      Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the
      Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season,
      which is roughly every four to six months.

    uuid: 8a3dac72-7ba1-4a03-b45c-f36d0dc9ce66
    content: >-
      In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets to align the
      community around Collective Intents. One can apply by submitting a Mission
      proposal on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to
      their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token
      House every six months.

      Token House is a key component of the Optimism Collective's governance
      structure. It was created in conjunction with the OP token launch, which
      was distributed to addresses that showed positive, community-oriented
      behavior through the first airdrop. The Token House Governance Contract
      acts as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals
      submitted by Token House members.

      The Optimism Governance Portal simplifies the voting process by providing
      a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting
      power and cast their votes on-chain. There are several ways to obtain OP
      tokens and join the Optimism ecosystem, including airdrops and trading
      platforms.

      Engagement within the Optimism ecosystem can also lead to earning OP
      tokens. Those who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of
      Optimism's technology may be eligible for token rewards or incentives.
      Keeping up with the Optimism community and official communication channels
      can help contributors stay informed about potential token earning
      opportunities.

      The Optimism Forum is a key part of the governance process, providing a
      platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It
      allows Token House members to engage in meaningful conversations and share
      their views. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to
      governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance
      experience.

      OP token holders can participate in the decentralized governance of the
      Optimism ecosystem. They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to
      the protocol and cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades
      and fee structures. Through their proposals and votes, they play a crucial
      role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism
      network.

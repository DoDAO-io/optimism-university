      Account abstraction is a concept that allows users to use smart contracts
      as their accounts instead of the traditional Externally Owned Accounts
      (EOA). While EOAs have been the default choice for most users, the
      adoption of smart accounts has been increasing due to the enhanced user
      experiences they offer.

      By leveraging account abstraction, users can explore new possibilities and
      create more innovative dapps and wallets. One significant advantage of
      using smart contracts as accounts is the cost-effectiveness it brings.

      For instance, deploying a contract wallet on the OP Stack is 34 times
      cheaper than on the Ethereum Mainnet. This cost reduction can be a
      game-changer for developers and businesses looking to build, onboard, and
      scale their dapps.

      To support account abstraction, various infrastructure components have
      been developed. One such example is the ERC-4337 bundler, which allows
      developers to bundle multiple transactions together, reducing gas costs
      and improving efficiency.

      Additionally, gas manager APIs are available on the OP Mainnet, providing
      developers with tools to manage gas consumption effectively. These
      infrastructure components empower developers to optimize their dapps and
      wallets, ensuring a seamless user experience.

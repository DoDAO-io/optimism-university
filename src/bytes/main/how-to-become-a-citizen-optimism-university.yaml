      Becoming a citizen is a significant process that involves being recognized
      as a member of a specific community or country. In the context of the
      Citizens' House, citizenship is based on identity and aligning with the
      values of the Collective. This differs from the more common practice of
      token-voting governance.

      To initiate the process of becoming a citizen in the Citizens' House,
      participants are given temporary badges that allow them to vote in
      RetroPGF rounds. These rounds serve as a platform for individuals to
      participate in the decision-making process of the Collective.

      However, having a voting badge does not guarantee permanent citizenship,
      as membership is determined by governance and may change over time. The
      Citizens' House collaborates with the Token House to establish criteria
      for participation in the Citizens' House.

      In the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across
      the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various
      subcultures and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens
      and contribute their expertise to the community. However, the criteria for
      citizenship may change as the governance of the community evolves.

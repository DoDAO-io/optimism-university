      The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of
      processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. The
      foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists
      of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing.

      To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs
      officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and
      entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and
      responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and
      other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.

      As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally
      accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes
      the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism
      Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and
      implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a
      commercially reasonable manner.

      However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are
      unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or
      would hinder its ability to function effectively. To ensure accountability
      and transparency, the foundation has implemented three governance proposal
      types. These proposals are designed to protect the rights of OP token
      holders and maintain transparency within the organization.

      The foundation's proposals let the collective vote on how to use OP
      tokens, ensuring funds match the group's goals and interests. Token
      holders help decide where resources go.

      The governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's
      Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board
      members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the
      removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or
      acts against the best interests of the foundation.

      The Token House, representing OP token holders, can veto changes to
      foundation documents that harm token holder rights. This safeguards their
      interests and ensures their voices are respected in document changes.

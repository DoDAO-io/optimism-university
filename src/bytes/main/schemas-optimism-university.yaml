      Schemas play a vital role in AttestationStation as they define the
      structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation. They
      act as a blueprint, ensuring that the data included in an attestation is
      organized and standardized. By following these predefined schemas, the
      information can be easily understood and processed by different systems.

      The purpose of these schemas is to provide a standardized format for the
      data included in an attestation. This allows different systems and
      applications to easily interpret and process the information. By adhering
      to these schemas, developers can ensure that their attestations are
      compatible with the existing infrastructure and can be seamlessly
      integrated into the ecosystem.

      There are different schemas like Optimist Profile schema, Gitcoin Passport
      V1 scores schema, RetroPGF Badgeholders schema, RetroPGF 3 Application
      schema, and RetroPGF 3 Lists schema. Each of these schemas specifies the
      structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation,

      AttestationStation v1, the platform used for managing attestations,
      provides support for these schemas. It allows users to create attestations
      that adhere to the predefined schemas, ensuring that the data is
      structured correctly. This simplifies the process of creating and managing
      attestations, as users can rely on the predefined schemas to guide them.

      In addition to providing structure and organization, schemas also
      contribute to the security and integrity of the attestations. By defining
      the type of data that can be included, schemas prevent the inclusion of
      malicious or unauthorized information. This ensures that the attestations
      are reliable and trustworthy, as they follow a predefined set of rules and
      standards.

      These user-friendly faucets make it convenient for developers to access
      the necessary resources for testing their applications. In some cases,
      developers may need to obtain L1 Goerli ETH from an Ethereum testnet
      faucet and then use the Optimism Bridge interface to bridge the testnet
      ETH to/from OP Goerli.

      networks, enabling them to test the functionality and compatibility of
      their applications across multiple environments. Additionally, if
      developers require ETH on OP Mainnet for contract deployment, they can
      bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to OP Mainnet.

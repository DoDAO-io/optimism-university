      The process for RetroPGF Round 1 involved two main stages: badgeholder
      selection and voting. In this round, 24 badgeholders, consisting of 8
      Optimists and 16 Ethereum community members, were chosen to vote on
      distributing retrofunding to the nominated projects. Anyone could nominate
      a project during the nomination period by providing the project name,
      project lead name, project lead email, and impact description. The
      badgeholders were then provided with a manual and asked to evaluate and
      vote on the nominated projects.

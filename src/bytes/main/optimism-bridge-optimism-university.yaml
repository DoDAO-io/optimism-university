      Optimism Bridge is a blockchain bridge, a tool that enables users to
      transfer assets from one blockchain to another. These blockchains can be
      either layer-1 chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Solana, or layer-2
      chains like Optimism or Arbitrum. The purpose of these bridges is to
      facilitate the movement of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, between
      different blockchains.

      Running OP Testnet from source allows users to set up and initialize their
      own test network for Optimism's Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Since OP
      Sepolia is a non-migrated network, it requires initialization via a
      genesis file.

      To initialize the data directory, you'll need to download the genesis JSON
      and run the following command: `curl -o <path to genesis JSON> -sL <URL to
      genesis JSON>`.

      To create a shared secret between `op-geth` and `op-node`, navigate to
      your `op-geth` directory and run the command `openssl rand -hex 32 >
      jwt.txt`. This shared secret will ensure secure communication between the
      different components of the OP Testnet.

      In the root of your working directory, create a new directory called
      `scripts`. Inside this directory, insert a snippet of code into the
      run-`op-geth.sh` file and modify the path to the `op-geth` directory.

      Before you can use the OP Testnet, you need to synchronize the data
      directory. The datadir provided by Optimism is not updated continuously,
      so synchronization is necessary. While the synchronization process is
      ongoing, you will receive log messages from `op-node`.

      To estimate how long the synchronization will take, you can use the
      Foundry script provided. Simply navigate to your scripts directory, create
      a new file called `run-estimate.sh`, and run the command
      `./run-estimate.sh` to get an estimate of the synchronization time.

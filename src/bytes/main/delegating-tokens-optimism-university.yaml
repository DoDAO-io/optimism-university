      Participating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a
      time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to
      delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to
      actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not
      to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself
      in order to vote.

      Delegating your voting power is a crucial decision, so it is essential to
      take the time to read through delegate statements of interest. These
      statements provide insights into the delegate's stance on various
      governance matters. By carefully considering these statements, you can
      select a delegate who aligns with your values and priorities.

      Delegating tokens to a representative allows you to transfer your voting
      power to someone who will actively participate in Token House governance
      on your behalf. By doing so, you retain 100% ownership of your tokens and
      can use them as you wish. To delegate your tokens, you can visit the
      delegates app and follow the instructions provided.

      If you prefer not to delegate your voting power to a representative, you
      have the option to delegate to yourself. By following the delegate
      commitment template on the Optimism Governance Portal, you can register as
      a delegate and retain full control over your voting power. After
      completing the process, visit the delegates app to confirm that you have
      successfully delegated your tokens to your own address.

      Once you have been added as a delegate in the next voting cycle, you can
      start voting on governance matters. Remember, a healthy governance system
      benefits both Optimism and all OP token holders. By reviewing these
      communications, you can stay informed about the actions and decisions made
      on your behalf.

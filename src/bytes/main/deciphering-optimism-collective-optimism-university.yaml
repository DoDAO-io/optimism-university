      The Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape
      the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the
      current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the
      economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world.
      However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely
      replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth.

      Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and
      reward the creators of these public goods for their impact. The Optimism
      Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital
      democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and
      citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive
      impact with profit.

      This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating
      the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective
      aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable
      and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that
      benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole.

      By incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective
      propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective
      expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public
      goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the
      digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic
      human needs at scale.

      The Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and
      profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded
      because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and
      organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the
      Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals
      profit.

      previously. However, starting from 2023, several hundred active addresses
      have been invited to mint each month based on their participation in the
      Optimism Collective and data recorded in the AttestationStation.

      As the Optimism ecosystem grows, new traits will be unlocked based on an

      engages with the Optimism ecosystem, the more unique traits they can
      unlock for their Optimist NFT.

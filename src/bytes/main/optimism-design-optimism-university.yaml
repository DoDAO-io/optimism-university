      Optimism's design is closely aligned with the Ethereum vision, aiming to
      create an optimistic future for the Ethereum ecosystem. The goal is to
      create a system that is as simple as possible while providing the
      necessary features. By minimizing the number of moving parts, Optimism
      gains significant advantages over more complex Layer 2 constructions.

      This simplicity reduces engineering overhead, allowing the team to focus
      on developing new features instead of recreating existing ones. It also
      enhances security by reducing the potential for unintentional bugs and
      makes the codebase more accessible to external contributors and auditors.

      The team acknowledges real-world constraints, the needs of projects built
      on Optimism, and the problems faced by users. The philosophy prioritizes
      user and developer needs over theoretical perfection. The development of
      Optimism is iterative, with continuous feedback from users playing a
      crucial role in shaping the protocol.

      This approach has enabled the implementation of features like EVM
      Equivalence, which were made possible through user input and iterative
      development. The team recognizes that a scalable system is meaningless
      without a sustainable ecosystem to support it.

      To ensure long-term sustainability, Optimism's protocol design aligns with
      the philosophy of simplicity. By keeping the codebase simple, Optimism can
      build a larger community of contributors who can help maintain the
      protocol over time. Sustainability is a key consideration in the design
      process, as shortcuts to scalability are avoided in favor of a robust and
      enduring system.

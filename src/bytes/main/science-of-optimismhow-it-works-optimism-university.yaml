      Optimism functions by utilizing the security of another blockchain,
      referred to as the parent chain. Instead of having its own consensus
      mechanism, Optimistic Rollups depend on the consensus mechanism of the
      parent chain, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

      In the case of Optimism, L2 blocks are stored on the Ethereum blockchain
      using a non-contract address. Once these blocks are submitted as
      transaction calldata on Ethereum, they cannot be altered or censored. This
      ensures the availability and integrity guarantees of Ethereum are
      inherited by the Optimism network.

      Optimism block production is primarily managed by a single party called
      the 'sequencer.' In Bedrock, the sequencer has a private mempool, similar
      to Ethereum's L1, to prevent opportunities for MEV (Miner Extractable
      Value). Blocks are produced every two seconds on OP Mainnet, regardless of
      whether they are empty or filled with transactions.

      Transactions submitted on the Ethereum L1, known as deposits, are included
      in the appropriate L2 block. Each L2 block is identified by its epoch (the
      corresponding L1 block) and a serial number within that epoch. The first
      block of the epoch includes all the deposits that occurred in the
      corresponding L1 block.

      The execution engine, implemented as the op-geth component, receives
      blocks using two mechanisms. It can update itself using a peer-to-peer
      network with other execution engines, similar to how L1 execution clients
      synchronize the state across the network or the rollup node, implemented
      as the op-node component, derives the L2 blocks from the L1 blockchain.

      Blockchain's fragmentation poses substantial challenges to project growth.
      Smaller user bases lead to less security, innovation, and adoption.
      Interoperability between chains is difficult and expensive, causing
      inefficiencies. This complexity deters new users from entering the
      blockchain space.

      Developers face difficulties in creating applications that function across
      multiple chains, stifling innovation and discouraging participation in
      blockchain projects. To address these issues, Optimism has developed the
      Superchain, an innovative network of chains. The Superchain has unique
      features, including shared security, a communication layer, and a
      development stack.

      The Superchain is a horizontally scalable system that unlocks the
      potential for massive scaling, encourages the development of novel
      applications, and introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers
      based on the fees generated by their chains. The foundation of the
      Superchain rests on the OP Stack, a fully open-source and modular
      development stack that sets the standard for decentralized infrastructure.

      One of the primary goals of implementing the Superchain is to
      significantly increase the transaction throughput of Ethereum. This
      improvement aims to enable more users to utilize the Ethereum network
      without encountering congestion or high fees. However, relying solely on a
      single chain can potentially lead to centralization concerns.

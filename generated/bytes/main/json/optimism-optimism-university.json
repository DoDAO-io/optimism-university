Transactions occur on the Optimism chain, but the transaction data is posted and validated on the Ethereum mainnet.

      "content": "Layer-2 (L2) is a secondary layer built on top of a main blockchain (Layer-1 or L1) to improve its speed and scalability. It helps process transactions faster and reduce congestion on the main blockchain. Examples include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Optimistic Rollups for Ethereum.",

      "content": "Layer-2 solutions are essential because they tackle the inherent limitations of Layer-1 blockchains. Main blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin often struggle with slow transaction processing and high fees when they become congested due to increased user activity. Layer-2 solutions provide a remedy by offloading a portion of the transaction load onto secondary layers.",

      "content": "These secondary layers, while independently operated, remain secured by the primary blockchain's consensus mechanisms. As a result, Layer-2 solutions significantly enhance transaction speeds, reduce costs, and increase the overall capacity of blockchain networks. They make blockchain technology more practical for a wide range of applications, from everyday transactions to decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.",

      "content": "Rollup is a type of layer two solution to solve the Ethereum scalability problem. Roll ups work by executing transactions outside the main ethereum chain, while submitting data to the base chain. This means that layer-2 networks can handle the processing of transactions much faster than the base blockchain, since there is a smaller validator set with better hardware.",

      "content": "Optimism is categorized as an 'Optimistic Rollup,' which is essentially a blockchain that relies on the security of another blockchain, known as the parent chain. In this case, Optimism leverages the consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), of the Ethereum mainnet. By doing so, Optimism can benefit from the robust security measures already in place on the parent chain, ensuring the safety and integrity of transactions on the Optimism chain.",

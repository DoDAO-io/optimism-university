This fund is designed to directly support the communities and companies, known as OPCOs, that drive the expansion of the Collective ecosystem. The allocation dedicated to the Ecosystem Fund will be divided into different categories. The Ecosystem Fund is intended to be a kick-starting mechanism that will eventually be phased out once the OP in the fund has been depleted. 25% of the OP tokens are allocated to this fund.",

## Voting Cycles

Voting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token holders participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last for five weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting on governance proposals. They commence and conclude at specific times.

## Special Voting Cycles

Special Voting Cycles are integral part of the governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's structure based on feedback received during the previous season.

## Reflection Periods

During these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.

## Role of Reflection Periods

To allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.

## Importance of Voting Cycles

These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.

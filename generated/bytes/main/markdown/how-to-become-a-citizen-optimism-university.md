## How to Become a Citizen?


## Introduction

Becoming a citizen is a significant process that involves being recognized as a member of a specific community or country. In the context of the Citizens' House, citizenship is based on identity and aligning with the values of the Collective. This differs from the more common practice of token-voting governance.

## Citizenship Initiation

To initiate the process of becoming a citizen in the Citizens' House, participants are given temporary badges that allow them to vote in RetroPGF rounds. These rounds serve as a platform for individuals to participate in the decision-making process of the Collective.

## Membership Criteria

However, having a voting badge does not guarantee permanent citizenship, as membership is determined by governance and may change over time. The Citizens' House collaborates with the Token House to establish criteria for participation in the Citizens' House.

## Future Goals

In the future, the goal is to have a widely distributed citizenship across the Optimism ecosystem. This means that individuals from various subcultures and industries will have the opportunity to become citizens and contribute their expertise to the community. However, the criteria for citizenship may change as the governance of the community evolves.

## Grants-Token House


## Grants Council

The Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders, Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs).

## Builder Grants

Builders grants focus on increasing the number of developers and visionaries creating innovative applications on Optimism. The Council prioritizes projects aligned with their mission to advance the Builders community. They assess proposals based on how well they contribute to this mission.

    


---
## Experiments Grants

Experiments grants aim to encourage the adoption of new applications and practical use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants, these grants target end users and are not for the proposer's use. The proposal forms for Experiments grants focus on how the project will broaden the reach of the Optimism ecosystem and boost the adoption of valuable applications.

## Requests for Grants

Requests for Grants (RFGs) mark a pivotal phase in the grant process. They are prompted by the specific needs of the Optimism ecosystem, inviting teams to propose solutions to pressing issues. The Council outlines the requirements for each request, including proposal submission guidelines and evaluation criteria.

## Council's Voting Cycle

The Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to process applications. It is important to refer to the governance calendar for the schedule and deadlines.

## Token House Missions

The Token House plays a vital role in the Optimism Collective, voting to approve Missions, which are specific initiatives in line with Collective Intents and eligible for grants. All Intent #2 proposals are grant applications reviewed by the Grants Council. The Token House votes on Missions once per Season, which occurs approximately every four to six months.

## Season 4 Initiatives

In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. One can apply by submitting a Mission proposal on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six months.

## Structure of Grants

In the case of user incentives, grants provided by the fund are directly distributed to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem in the form of liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives whereas projects grants have a 1-year token lockup period, meaning the granted tokens cannot be immediately sold or transferred.

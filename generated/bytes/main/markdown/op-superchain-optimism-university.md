## OP Superchain


## Fragmentation Challenges

Blockchain's fragmentation poses substantial challenges to project growth. Smaller user bases lead to less security, innovation, and adoption. Interoperability between chains is difficult and expensive, causing inefficiencies. This complexity deters new users from entering the blockchain space.

## Superchain Solution

Developers face difficulties in creating applications that function across multiple chains, stifling innovation and discouraging participation in blockchain projects. To address these issues, Optimism has developed the Superchain, an innovative network of chains. The Superchain has unique features, including shared security, a communication layer, and a development stack.

## Superchain Features

The Superchain is a horizontally scalable system that unlocks the potential for massive scaling, encourages the development of novel applications, and introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers based on the fees generated by their chains. The foundation of the Superchain rests on the OP Stack, a fully open-source and modular development stack that sets the standard for decentralized infrastructure.

## Ethereum Impact

One of the primary goals of implementing the Superchain is to significantly increase the transaction throughput of Ethereum. This improvement aims to enable more users to utilize the Ethereum network without encountering congestion or high fees. However, relying solely on a single chain can potentially lead to centralization concerns.

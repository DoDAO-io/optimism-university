## Understanding Optimism Bridge


## Introduction

Optimism Bridge is a blockchain bridge, a tool that enables users to transfer assets from one blockchain to another. These blockchains can be either layer-1 chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Solana, or layer-2 chains like Optimism or Arbitrum. The purpose of these bridges is to facilitate the movement of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, between different blockchains.

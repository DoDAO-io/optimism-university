## Optimist Profile


## Introduction

The Optimist Profile is a feature that enables contributors to showcase their contributions and influence on the Optimism Collective. It is an open platform where anyone can create an Optimist Profile and use it for onchain identity applications.

## Profile Elements

The Optimist Profile is constructed using a variety of onchain reputation data on OP Mainnet. It includes elements such as Profile Schema, which is an onchain self-attestation representing an individual or organization, and Contributions, where each profile can create onchain attestations about their contributions.

## Peer Attestations

Optimist Profiles can also be used to create onchain peer-to-peer attestations about the contributions of other contributors, helping the Optimism Collective create a web of trust based on contributions.

    


---
## Technical Details

The Optimist Profile is built on attestations using the Ethereum Attestation Service. The profile schema includes a unique identifier, name of the profile, and metadata pointers that can point to any type of blob storage storing the metadata.

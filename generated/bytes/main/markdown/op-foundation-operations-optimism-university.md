## Operational Structure

To execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.

## Legal Obligations

As a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner.

## Proposal Limitations

However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively. To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the organization.

## Financial Alignment

The foundation's proposals let the collective vote on how to use OP tokens, ensuring funds match the group's goals and interests. Token holders help decide where resources go.

## Board Accountability

The governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts against the best interests of the foundation.

## Token Holder Rights

The Token House, representing OP token holders, can veto changes to foundation documents that harm token holder rights. This safeguards their interests and ensures their voices are respected in document changes.

## Schemas


## Schemas Role

Schemas play a vital role in AttestationStation as they define the structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation. They act as a blueprint, ensuring that the data included in an attestation is organized and standardized. By following these predefined schemas, the information can be easily understood and processed by different systems.

## Schemas Security

In addition to providing structure and organization, schemas also contribute to the security and integrity of the attestations. By defining the type of data that can be included, schemas prevent the inclusion of malicious or unauthorized information. This ensures that the attestations are reliable and trustworthy, as they follow a predefined set of rules and standards.

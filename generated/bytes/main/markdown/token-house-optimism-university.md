## Token House


## Introduction

Token House is a key component of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was created in conjunction with the OP token launch, which was distributed to addresses that showed positive, community-oriented behavior through the first airdrop. The Token House Governance Contract acts as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members.

## Network Faucets


## Introduction

Network faucets supply testnet Ether (ETH) for development and testing. They aid developers in experimenting with applications, replicating real scenarios, and ensuring functionality and security without using actual cryptocurrencies.

## Coinbase and QuickNode

Coinbase Wallet users have the advantage of obtaining test ETH directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or through the Coinbase Faucet website. This integration simplifies the process of acquiring testnet ETH for OP Goerli. Another option is the Optimism Faucet for Goerli by QuickNode, which offers an effortless way to acquire testnet ETH for OP Goerli.

## User-Friendly Faucets

These user-friendly faucets make it convenient for developers to access the necessary resources for testing their applications. In some cases, developers may need to obtain L1 Goerli ETH from an Ethereum testnet faucet and then use the Optimism Bridge interface to bridge the testnet ETH to/from OP Goerli.

## Cross-Network Functionality

This process allows developers to transfer testnet ETH between different networks, enabling them to test the functionality and compatibility of their applications across multiple environments. Additionally, if developers require ETH on OP Mainnet for contract deployment, they can bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to OP Mainnet.

## Alternative Funding

For developers who need ETH for expenses, there is an alternative option available. By bridging enough USDC courtesy of Perpetual Protocol, developers can obtain ETH to cover their expenses. This provides developers with a convenient way to access the necessary funds for testing and deploying their applications.

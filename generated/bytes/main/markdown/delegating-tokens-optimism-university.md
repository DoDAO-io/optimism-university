## Delegating Tokens


## Introduction

Participating in the governance of the Optimism Token House can be a time-consuming task. To address this, individuals have the option to delegate their voting power to a community member who has volunteered to actively participate in Token House governance. However, if you prefer not to delegate your voting power, you will still need to delegate to yourself in order to vote.

After completing the process, visit the delegates app to confirm that you have successfully delegated your tokens to your own address.

## Using Optimism Bridge

To start using the Optimism Bridge, connect your wallet to the platform. This can be done by locating the 'Connect Wallet' button, which is typically found at the bottom or top-right corner of the page. Follow the provided instructions to successfully connect your wallet to the platform.

## Source Chain Selection

Once your wallet is connected, you'll find a drop-down menu in the 'From' section. This is where you select your source chain or Centralized Exchange (CEX). For this guide, Ethereum is assumed as the source chain.

## Token Selection

After selecting the source chain, choose the specific token you wish to bridge from the source chain to Optimism. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the transaction confirmation process.

## Transaction Confirmation

Post transaction confirmation, you'll have to wait for it to be confirmed on the Ethereum network. The time taken for the bridging process to complete depends on the network traffic and the gas fees you opt to pay.

## Transaction Monitoring

While waiting for the transaction confirmation, you can monitor its status on the Ethereum network using a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. This feature allows you to track your tokens' progress as they move from the source chain to the Optimism network.

## Process of RetroPGF 


## RetroPGF Functioning

The RetroPGF process works by allocating a portion of the revenue generated by the sequencer, the entity responsible for submitting optimistic rollup transactions to Ethereum, back to the Optimism Collective. This revenue is then used to fund public goods that have already been provided by entities and projects within the ecosystem.

    


---
## Funds Distribution

The distribution of funds is managed through a governance structure known as the Citizens' House. This body votes on a quarterly basis on how the funds should be allocated to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a positive impact on the ecosystem.

    


---
## Investment Opportunity

RetroPGF not only rewards community members for their contributions but also provides an opportunity for early investment in public goods projects. It offers possible exit liquidity, allowing builders to be compensated for their positive contributions without solely relying on generating direct revenue.

    


---
## Capital Raising

The process also allows these builders to raise capital based on the potential and promise of their projects. As more public goods are funded, the ecosystem improves, leading to increased demand for Optimism blockspace.

    


---
## Ecosystem Growth

The increase in demand generates more revenue for the sequencer, which can then be used for further retroactive public goods funding. This cycle continues to drive the growth and development of the ecosystem.

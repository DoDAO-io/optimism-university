## Optimism Superchain


## Overview

### Fragmented Ecosystem

The fragmented nature of the blockchain ecosystem presents significant challenges for the growth and success of blockchain projects. This fragmentation limits the network effects that are crucial for their prosperity. Smaller user bases result in reduced security, limited innovation, and lower adoption rates. Additionally, transferring value or data between different chains becomes a complex and costly endeavor, introducing inefficiencies and diminishing overall usability. The resulting confusion and uncertainty create hurdles for new users looking to enter the blockchain space. Developers also face difficulties in creating applications that seamlessly function across multiple chains, stifling innovation and discouraging participation in blockchain projects.

### Optimism's Solution: The Superchain

</div>

In response to these challenges, Optimism has developed the Superchainâ€”an innovative network of chains designed to address these issues head-on. The Superchain is characterized by its unique features, including shared security, a communication layer, and a development stack. This horizontally scalable system unlocks the potential for massive scaling, encourages the development of novel applications, and introduces a new revenue model that rewards developers based on the fees generated by their chains. The Superchain's foundation rests on the OP Stack, a fully open-source and modular development stack that sets the standard for decentralized infrastructure.

### Enhancing Ethereum's Scalability

One of the primary goals of implementing the Superchain is to significantly increase the transaction throughput of Ethereum. This improvement aims to enable more users to utilize the Ethereum network without encountering congestion or high fees. However, it's essential to recognize that relying solely on a single chain can potentially lead to centralization concerns. Moreover, the implementation of this complex solution demands extensive development and rigorous testing to ensure its robustness and security. Furthermore, user adoption of this new solution may present challenges and serve as a potential barrier to realizing the full extent of scalability improvements.

## Structure Of The OP Superchain

OP chains within the Optimism Superchain are constructed with a standardized architecture that enhances their functionality and interoperability. This standardized architecture consists of several key components:

### Shared Bridge

A critical component of the OP chain architecture is a shared bridge that connects the base layer to the OP chains. This bridge serves the crucial role of ensuring the standardization of security measures across the entire Superchain.

### OP Chains

OP chains represent the individual chains within the Optimism Superchain. These chains are an essential part of the architecture and contribute to the overall functionality of the Superchain.

### Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol

To facilitate the seamless transfer of data and digital assets between OP chains, a cross-chain messaging protocol is integrated into the architecture. This protocol plays a pivotal role in ensuring efficient communication and data exchange between different OP chains.

### Total Transaction Ordering

One of the standout features of this architecture is its ability to establish total transaction ordering across all OP Chains. This unique capability empowers developers to create applications targeting the Superchain as a unified platform, abstracting the complexities of the underlying chains on which these applications run.

## Upgrading Optimism

The concept of upgrading optimism to become a superchain involves implementing several changes to the existing system in order to create a more efficient and secure network:

### Initial Superchain
To create an initial superchain, it is necessary to put all information defining the L2 chain on-chain. This includes generating a unique chain ID and configuring key values such as block gas limit. By doing so, a factory can be created to deploy the configuration and all other required contracts for each chain. This allows for the deployment and upgrade of multiple chains with the same bridge, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

### Contract Addresses
To further enhance the superchain, contract addresses can be made deterministic using the CREATE2 function. This means that given a chain configuration, it is possible to determine all bridge addresses associated with that chain. This eliminates the need to deploy bridge contracts for each chain, making chain deployment virtually free. It also allows chains to inherit standard security properties, making the system more secure and reliable.

### Permissionless Proposals
In the current system, withdrawals require a permissioned entity known as the proposer. This introduces overhead and limits the number of chains in the superchain. To address this, permissionless proposals can be introduced, allowing anyone to submit a withdrawal proposal. This removes the need for a designated proposer and enables users to submit their own withdrawal messages. Additionally, the proposal submission interval can be removed, allowing withdrawal claims to be made only when a user needs to withdraw. This streamlines the process and improves efficiency.

</div>

### Permissionless Proof System
To enable permissionless proposals and withdrawal claims, a permissionless proof system can be introduced. In the envisioned fault proof system, anyone can submit a withdrawal claim at any time. These claims can be permissionless when accompanied by bonds, which act as collateral. If a claim is proven to be invalid, the bond is paid out to the challenger, preventing spam and ensuring the security of the system. The fault proof system relies on a trusted set of chain attestors to arbitrate disputes and prioritize safety over liveness.

### Sequencer Decentralization
To achieve sequencer decentralization, the sequencer address can be configured by the OP Chain deployer. This allows different entities to sequence OP Chains while retaining the standard security model. Safety is guaranteed by the proof system, and liveness is ensured by the ability to submit transactions directly to L1. Modular sequencing also enables permissionless experimentation with different sequencing models, fostering competition and innovation.

### Decentralized Security Council
To ensure security and decentralization, a decentralized security council should be introduced to govern upgrades. This council would have the authority to update chain attestors, initiate contract upgrades with a delay, and pause the bridge in case of emergencies. The ability to pause the bridge prevents the loss of funds and ensures the safety of the system. In case of a security breach, the council can indefinitely pause withdrawals and cancel pending upgrades, protecting the network and user funds.

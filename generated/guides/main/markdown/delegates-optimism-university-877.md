## Delegates


## Overview

### Who is a Delegate?

Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. The Optimism blockchain, built on the Ethereum network, is one such innovative technology. It utilizes a unique system of delegates to manage the governance of the network. 

In the Optimism blockchain, a delegate is an individual selected to make governance decisions on behalf of token holders. Token holders have the option to delegate their voting power to someone else, who will then represent them in decision-making processes. It is important to note that token holders retain full ownership of their tokens and can change their delegates at any time.

### Role of Delegates
Delegates in the Optimism blockchain are responsible for managing the governance of the network. They propose, vote, and execute changes to the network, ensuring its smooth operation. To be eligible for election as a delegate, individuals must meet specific criteria, such as holding a minimum number of tokens and having a good reputation within the community.

Once elected, delegates can propose changes to the network, such as protocol upgrades or modifications to the fee structure. These proposals are then put to a vote, allowing token holders to express their support or opposition. The proposal with the highest number of votes is executed, and the delegate is responsible for implementing the approved changes.

Delegates play a crucial role in the governance of the Optimism blockchain. By allowing token holders to delegate their voting power, the network becomes more democratic and less susceptible to control by a small group of individuals. Delegates ensure that the network is managed in a fair and transparent manner, preventing centralization and promoting inclusivity.

As blockchain technology evolves, it is essential to have a mechanism in place for making necessary changes to the network. Delegates provide this mechanism in the Optimism blockchain. They help ensure that the network remains up-to-date and secure by proposing and implementing upgrades and maintenance activities.

## Becoming a Delegate

Participating in Token House governance can be a time-consuming task. To alleviate this burden, individuals have the option to delegate their voting power to community members who have volunteered to actively participate in Token House governance. However, being a delegate is not a responsibility to be taken lightly. Before deciding to become a delegate, it is crucial to understand the responsibilities and commitments that come with this role. Let's explore the steps to becoming a delegate and the expectations associated with it:

### Commit
The first step towards becoming a delegate is to familiarize yourself with the delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities can be found on the [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) dedicated to Token House governance. It is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend these responsibilities to ensure that you are fully aware of what is expected from you as a delegate. Understanding these responsibilities will help you make an informed decision about whether or not you are ready to take on this role.

</div>

### Set up Profile
Once you have familiarized yourself with the delegate responsibilities, the next step is to register as a delegate on the [Optimism Governance Portal (Optimism Agora)](https://vote.optimism.io/). This portal serves as the platform for Token House governance, and registering as a delegate will allow you to actively participate in the decision-making process. To register, you will need to complete the [delegate commitment form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) provided on the portal. This form will require you to provide relevant information and agree to fulfill your responsibilities as a delegate.

While not mandatory, it is advisable to delegate your own OP tokens' voting power to yourself. By doing so, you retain control over your voting power and can actively participate in the decision-making process. Self-delegating ensures that your voice is heard and that you have a say in the governance of Token House. However, it is important to note that token grants should not be self-delegated to grant recipients. This ensures fairness and prevents any conflicts of interest.

## Guidelines

Existing delegates play a crucial role in the governance process. By keeping in mind the following guidelines, delegates can effectively contribute to the decision-making process and help shape the future of the community:

### 1. Join Discord Channels
As an existing delegate, it is important to actively participate in the governance discussions. Join the relevant channels on [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) to engage in conversations with other delegates and stay updated on important governance events. The [#gov-general channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919) is specifically designed for general governance discussions, while the [#token-house-gov channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/991340698995544176) provides announcements about significant events in the governance process. Additionally, the [#grants channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1069653708369047623) allows delegates to discuss the grants process and provide feedback to grant applicants. Lastly, the [#delegate-discussion channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241) is a platform for larger delegates to collaborate and discuss proposals and the overall governance process.

### 2. Provide Feedback
To contribute to the decision-making process, delegates should provide feedback on draft proposals. This can be done in the [Proposals Discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38) section of the Forum. By sharing your thoughts and insights, you can help shape the direction of the proposals and ensure that they align with the interests of the community. Remember, your feedback can have a significant impact on the final outcome of the proposals.

### 3. Approve Non-Grant Proposals
If you possess more than 0.5% of the voting supply, you have the authority to approve non-grant proposals. To exercise this power, simply post the following phrase in a forum comment on Discourse: "I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote." By approving proposals, you contribute to the decision-making process and help determine which proposals should proceed to the voting stage.

### 4. Vote on Non-Grant Proposals
As an existing delegate, it is crucial to exercise your voting power on non-grant proposals. Utilize the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/) to cast your vote and make your voice heard. Remember to carefully consider the proposals and their potential impact on the community before making your decision. Additionally, after voting, it is recommended to provide a voting rationale in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41). This allows you to explain your decision and engage in further discussions with other delegates.

### 5. Stay Up to Date
To effectively fulfill your role as a delegate, it is essential to stay informed about voting cycles and general governance updates. The Governance section of the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41) provides valuable information on these matters. Additionally, the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) highlights when important governance calls take place. By staying up to date, you can actively participate in the decision-making process and contribute to the overall governance of the community.

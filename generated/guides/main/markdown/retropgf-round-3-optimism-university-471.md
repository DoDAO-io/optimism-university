## Categories

In the Optimism ecosystem, there are various types of contributors who are eligible for RetroPGF, a program that rewards impactful work. Whether you are a developer working on an Ethereum execution client or an educator creating Optimism-inspired video content, as long as you are making a positive impact, you are eligible to participate in RetroPGF.

RetroPGF Round 3 is open to all Optimism artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists. It doesn't matter what role you play in the ecosystem; if your work has made an impact in any of the four categories, you should consider submitting an application for RetroPGF.

### Impact Categories

The RetroPGF program is structured around four categories, each representing a different aspect of the Optimism ecosystem:

<div align="center">
  <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retropgf_round_3_optimism_university_471/1695647253565_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png"/>
</div>

**OP Stack:** This category focuses on work that enhances the efficiency, security, resilience, and awareness of the OP Stack. If your contribution has improved any of these aspects, you should consider selecting this category.

**Collective Governance:** If your work has provided impact to governance participants of the Optimism Collective or has helped bring new participants into the Collective, this is the category for you. It recognizes the efforts made towards strengthening the governance structure of Optimism.

**Developer Ecosystem:** This category acknowledges work that has provided impact to application developers in the Optimism Collective or has helped bring new developers into the Collective. If your contribution has made a difference in this area, you should consider selecting this category.

**End User Experience & Adoption:** The final category focuses on work that has provided impact to end users in the Optimism Collective or has helped bring new users into the Collective. If your work has improved the experience of end users or has contributed to the adoption of Optimism, this category is relevant to you.

While you can select multiple categories, it is recommended to choose the ones that best describe the impact of your work. RetroPGF rewards will be allocated based on the assessment of your individual profile, so it is important to select the categories that align with your contributions. It is worth noting that selecting all categories will not give you an advantage in the evaluation process.

## Application Guidelines

When applying for Optimism Contributions, it is important to follow the guidelines provided to ensure your application is considered. These guidelines are designed to help badgeholders understand the impact of your contributions and determine the appropriate RetroPGF amount. The following are the key points one should keep in mind when submitting their application:

### Key Details First
To capture the attention of badgeholders, it is crucial to provide the most important information in the first few sentences of your application. This will help them quickly understand the nature of your work and its relevance to Optimism. Avoid making promises or alluding to future plans, as this may lead to disqualification.

### Highlight the Impact
It is crucial to be specific about the impact your contributions have on Optimism. Describe how your work benefits the Collective and who specifically benefits from it. Whether it's a consumer app, an infrastructure project, or a community tool, emphasize the positive outcomes and the value it brings to Optimism. By clearly articulating the impact, you can demonstrate the significance of your contributions. Make sure to add links to resources that showcase your work.

### Impact Metrics
To further demonstrate the value of your contributions, consider including impact metrics. These can be quantitative or qualitative measurements that highlight the impact of your work. Think about the metrics that best showcase how your contributions have supported the development and adoption of Optimism. Ensure that these metrics are verifiable by including links to data sources that badgeholders can use to verify them. If you are choosing a category for your application, make sure to connect your impact description and metrics to the success metrics of that category. This will help badgeholders understand how your contributions have driven towards the overall success of Optimism. 

### Grants & Funding
Badgeholders need to understand the financial support you have already received for your contributions. Provide accurate information about grants or revenue directly related to the contributions you are seeking RetroPGF for. This information will help determine the appropriate amount of RetroPGF for your work. You do not need to include VC funding or other investments in your project or person.

      "content": "The world of NFTs has seen a surge in popularity, and Optimism is no exception. Optimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, and it has its own unique NFT ecosystem. Let's explore some of the top NFT projects on Optimism and how they contribute to the overall ecosystem:\n\n\n### PFP Collections\nIn the early days of Optimism's development, PFP (Profile Picture) collections were all the rage. One such project is the [Optimism Ape Yacht Club](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Foayc.io%2F&psig=AOvVaw2zxeqmmg_KgqjEVPEV7bl6&ust=1695907025631000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjhxqFwoTCNiJiJbwyoEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAP) (OAYC), which holds the title for the most traded project on Optimism. However, there are also original PFP collections like [Apetimism](https://apetimism.com/), although it accounts for smaller trading volumes.\n\n### Velodrome Governance NFTs\n[Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/) Governance NFTs have become a ruling force in the Optimism NFT scene. These NFTs come with privileges in Velodrome Tokenomics, such as rebases that prevent voting power dilution. To obtain Velodrome NFTs, you can either lock $VELO tokens on their website or purchase them on secondary markets like Opensea.\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimist_nfts_optimism_university_698/1695821330771_untitled-2023-09-27-1740.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Optimism Quests NFTs\n[Optimism Quests](https://app.optimism.io/quests) NFTs have a different purpose. They aim to educate new users in the Optimism ecosystem. Season 1 of Optimism Quests involved 18 third-party apps on Optimism, and Season 2 is expected to take place in 2023. An interesting detail is that Optimism Quest NFTs can alter traits on \"Optimist NFTs,\" a PFP collection by the Optimism team. \n\n### Mirror Writing NFTs\n[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is a Web3 native blogging platform that has made its mark in the Optimism ecosystem with its Writing NFTs. These NFTs allow readers to collect blog post-related NFTs and support writers. It provides an opportunity for writers to monetize their work and build a community that genuinely supports their journey. The Mirror team saw the launch of Optimism as an opportunity to make collecting blog posts cheap and efficient through Writing NFTs.\n",

      "content": "[Optimist NFTs](https://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft) are digital avatars that allow individuals to express their personality and build their onchain identity. These NFTs are fully customizable, enabling users to create a one-of-a-kind avatar that represents their unique interests and traits. The vision behind Optimist NFTs is to reflect the identity and reputation of individuals as they interact with various projects and protocols. Currently in Beta, these NFTs are available for minting to voters in RetroPGF 2. However, the plan is to make them widely accessible to the entire crypto community as the Optimism Collective grows.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimist_nfts_optimism_university_698/1695395658814_untitled-2023-09-22-1859.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Unique Avatar\nWith Optimist NFTs, users have the power to design an avatar that truly reflects their individuality. These avatars can be customized to showcase personal style, interests, and traits. By creating a visually appealing and unique avatar, individuals can establish their presence in the Optimism ecosystem and build their reputation. The Optimist NFTs act as a representation of an individual Optimist, evolving alongside their identity and reputation as they engage with different projects and protocols.\n\n### Minting and Availability\nThe minting of Optimist NFTs was limited to voters in RetroPGF 2 previously. However, starting from 2023, several hundred active addresses have been invited to mint each month based on their participation in the Optimism Collective and data recorded in the AttestationStation.The ultimate goal is to make Optimist NFTs widely available for customization and minting as the Optimism Collective expands.\n\n### Unlocking New Traits\nAs the Optimism ecosystem grows, new traits will be unlocked based on an individual's participation. This means that the more actively someone engages with the Optimism ecosystem, the more unique traits they can unlock for their Optimist NFT. This incentivizes users to actively participate and contribute to the growth of the Optimism Collective, allowing them to further personalize their avatars and showcase their achievements within the ecosystem.",

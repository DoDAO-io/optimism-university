      "content": "### Grants Council\n\nThe Grants Council, elected by the Token House community, plays a crucial role in providing small to medium-sized grants to support various initiatives. These grants are divided into three categories: Builders, Experiments, and Requests for Grants (RFGs):\n\n**Builders grants** aim to maximize the number of builders, including developers and visionaries, who are building innovative applications on Optimism. The Council is particularly interested in projects that align with their mission of advancing the Builders community. When reviewing proposals, the Council looks for information that demonstrates how the project contributes to this mission.\n\n**Experiments grants** are designed to promote the adoption of novel applications and tangible use cases on Optimism. Unlike Builders grants, these grants are intended to reach end users and are not for the use of the proposer. The proposal forms for Experiments grants are specifically designed to gather information on how the project will expand the reach of the Optimism ecosystem and enhance the adoption of useful applications.\n\n**Requests for Grants (RFGs)** represent a transitional moment in the grant process. These grants are based on the needs of the Optimism ecosystem and are issued as requests for teams to submit proposals that address the most pressing problems. The Council specifies the requirements for each request, including how to submit a proposal and how the proposals will be assessed. The RFG process is dynamic and may be updated periodically.\n\nThe Grants Council follows a five-week cycle during regular Voting Cycles to process applications. It is important to refer to the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for the schedule and deadlines. \n\n\nThe following diagram showcases the procedure to submit a proposal:\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695318790109_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\n### Token House Missions\n\nThe Token House plays a crucial role in the Optimism Collective by voting on approving Missions. These Missions are specific initiatives that align with the Collective Intents and can receive grants. You can propose a Mission under Intent #1, Intent #3, or Intent #4. All proposals under Intent #2 should be grant applications that will be processed by the Grants Council. The Token House votes on these Missions once per Season, which is roughly every four to six months. In Season 4, the Foundation has suggested Intent Budgets to align the community around Collective Intents. Let's explore the different Intents and their proposed budgets:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695320088654_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\nOne can apply by submitting a [Mission proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to their Trust Tier. Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six months. \n",

      "content": "### Foundation Missions\nFoundation Missions are projects that the Optimism Foundation wants to undertake to further their goals. These missions are pre-specified by the foundation and are designed to address specific challenges or opportunities. They are supported by the Partner Fund, which means that the funding for these missions comes from external sources and not from the Governance Fund. The foundation carefully selects which proposals will be chosen to complete each mission, ensuring that they align with their vision and objectives.\n\nThe following are the types of Collective Trust Tiers which are the very first step towards establishing a connection between oneâ€™s positive impact in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles within the Collective:\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695644644531_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to a Foundation Mission, you can find an open mission on the list provided by the Optimism Foundation. Each mission will have a specified submission and selection deadline, so make sure to take note of these dates. To apply, you can simply reply as a comment on the [RFP's Github Issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP), providing your application and any relevant information. While the Token House, a governing body, does not vote on Foundation Missions, they have visibility into all RFP applications, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\n### Partner Fund\n\nThe Partner Fund, managed by the Optimism Foundation, is a grants program aimed at providing strategic and larger scale grants to partners who have already achieved product market fit. The primary objective of the Partner Fund is to foster the growth of Optimism's ecosystem for the benefit of the entire Collective.\n\nThe Partner Fund primarily focuses on projects that have already demonstrated success in the crypto space and are now looking to deploy and scale on the Optimism platform. These projects can be related to various areas of work, including Defi, NFTs, DAOs, and large scale usage growth for the ecosystem. By supporting these projects, the Partner Fund aims to build a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\nThe structure of the grants falls under these two categories:\n\n**User Incentives:** Grants provided by the fund are directly distributed to users of the project on the Optimism ecosystem. This can be in the form of liquidity mining, rewards, or other user incentives. By directly involving the users, the Partner Fund ensures that the grants have a meaningful impact on the growth and adoption of the projects.\n\n**Project Grants:** Projects that receive a grant from the Partner Fund, there is a 1-year token lockup period. This means that the granted tokens cannot be immediately sold or transferred. Instead, they can be used to support the operational costs of the project. This lockup period ensures that the granted tokens are utilized in a way that aligns with the long-term objectives of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nIt's important to note that the Optimism Foundation receives a large number of applications for the Partner Fund and can only support a select few that align with its objectives. Anyone can apply by simply filling out the [form](https://airtable.com/shrvQNlFPHGcVNqDe?prefill_Referrer=OPGov). There are no deadlines, applications are processed on a rolling basis",

      "content": "### Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF)\n\nRetroactive PGF (RetroPGF) is a program that rewards work that has already been completed for its positive impact. It is administered by the Citizens' House, which decides on the allocation of rewards based on the assessment of each project's contribution to the Collective. If you are working on a project aligned with the Collective and are comfortable with less upfront certainty regarding scope, reward amount, and timing, you may be eligible for RetroPGF rewards.\n\nRetroPGF is open to all contributors in the Optimism ecosystem, including artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists. Whether you are a developer working on an Ethereum execution client or an educator creating Optimism-inspired video content, as long as your work has made an impact, you are eligible to apply. \n\nThere are four categories in which your work can make an impact and be considered for RetroPGF rewards:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/getting_your_project_funded_optimism_university_587/1695644869646_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n**OP Stack:** The first category is OP Stack, which includes work that enhances the efficiency, security, resilience, and awareness of the OP Stack. \n\n**Collective Governance:** The second category is Collective Governance, which encompasses work that provides impact to governance participants of the Optimism Collective or helps bring new participants into the Collective.\n\n**Developer Ecosystem:** The third category is Developer Ecosystem, which focuses on work that provides impact to application developers in the Optimism Collective or helps attract new developers to the Collective. \n\n**End User Experience & Adoption:** The fourth category is End User Experience & Adoption, which recognizes work that provides impact to end users in the Optimism Collective or helps bring new users into the Collective.\n\n[Project applications](http://app.optimism.io/retropgf-signup) will be accepted from September 19th to October 23rd 2023. Applicants will typically have to provide detailed information about their projects. Following the project application period, a voting phase will take place. The voting period starts from November 6th to December 7th 2023. Voting badges have been offered to 208 community members. After the voting phase will conclude, the results of the selected projects will be determined. Starting in early January, the process of disbursing tokens or funding to the chosen projects will begin.",

      "content": "### What are Attestations?\n\nAttestations are described as digital signatures of structured data. They play a crucial role in representing trust and identity in digital interactions.They serve as fundamental components of decentralized identity systems. The challenge of numerous identity protocols being developed, leads to fragmentation in the ecosystem. This fragmentation makes it challenging for developers to create a comprehensive view of digital identity. Identity can be represented as an aggregate of attestations made by various entities over time. This means that entities can both receive and issue attestations about themselves, creating a comprehensive picture of their identity.\n\n### What is Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)?\n\nEthereum Attestation Service (EAS) is an open-source infrastructure designed to provide a public good for creating attestations. It is intended to serve as a foundational layer for various applications and use cases. EAS is versatile, supporting both on-chain and off-chain attestations. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable approach for their specific needs. It offers an SDK (Software Development Kit) along with a set of developer tools. These tools are designed to simplify the process of working with attestations, making it easier for developers to integrate EAS into their projects. EAS follows a grant-based funding model. This model ensures that EAS remains a public good and is not monetized as part of its infrastructure. The focus is on providing a service to the community rather than generating revenue from the infrastructure itself.\n\n### EAS Contracts\n\nEAS operates using two fundamental smart contracts. These contracts form the foundation of the service's functionality:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/attestationstation_optimism_university_196/1695984058527_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### Schema Registry Contract\n\nThis contract allows users to register structured data about various topics. It serves as a way to define and categorize the types of data that can be attested to within the EAS ecosystem.\n\n#### Attestation Contract\n\nThe second contract enables the creation of attestations based on the registered schemas. It is the core component responsible for generating and managing attestations.",

      "content": "### What is AttestationStation?\n\nAttestationStation is a crucial component in building decentralized identity applications. It is a smart contract that utilizes the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/atst-v1.html) standard to create, verify, and revoke on/off-chain attestations. Think of AttestationStation as a multiplayer database that streamlines the attestation process and establishes a robust web of trust on any OP Chain in the Superchain.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/attestationstation_optimism_university_196/1695726951931_untitled-2023-09-26-1601.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Advantages of AttestationStation\n\n- **Permissionless**: It is permissionless, meaning it is a public contract not owned or controlled by any individual or organization. \n\n- **Tooling**: It provides various tooling options such as indexing and access-management integrations, making it convenient for developers. \n\n- **Flexibility**: If you have a great idea but lack the technical expertise to build it, AttestationStation can be a valuable resource. Attestations also offer benefits over soulbound/non-transferable tokens, such as flexibility in choosing whether the attestation is onchain or offchain and improved interoperability.\n\n### Consideration Using Attestations\nWhen using attestations, it is important to prioritize user privacy. Attestations create log entries that become part of the permanent record on the blockchain. To protect users' privacy, explicit consent should be obtained for collecting personal information. Users should be clearly informed about the data being collected, the purpose of collection, and how it will be used. To ensure data security, sensitive information can be stored offchain using encryption, proper authentication, and authorization measures.\n\nAttestations should not be seen as replacements for verifiable credentials or decentralized identifiers. Instead, they can be used by developers to create decentralized identifiers, credentials, claims, and more. Attestations and the associated web of trust work in conjunction with proof of personhood solutions like WorldID. This combination helps prevent sybil-attacks and provides additional information about a person's reputation, which is crucial in governance and other use-cases. \n\n",

It provides a standardized format to present information about oneself or one's organization.\n\n### Contributions\nEach Optimist Profile can create onchain attestations about their contributions to the Optimism Collective. This means that users can highlight the specific ways in which they have made a positive impact within the community. They can also be used to create onchain peer-to-peer (p2p) attestations about the contributions of other contributors. This helps to establish a web of trust within the Optimism Collective, as individuals can vouch for the contributions of their peers.\n\nThe Optimist Profile is built on attestations using the Ethereum Attestation Service.

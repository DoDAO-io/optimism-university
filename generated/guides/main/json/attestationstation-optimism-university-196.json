      "content": "AttestationStation is a crucial component in building decentralized identity applications. It is a smart contract that utilizes the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/atst-v1.html) standard to create, verify, and revoke on/off-chain attestations. Think of AttestationStation as a multiplayer database that streamlines the attestation process and establishes a robust web of trust on any OP Chain in the Superchain.\n\nOne of the main advantages of AttestationStation is its ability to easily sign any piece of data. Additionally, it offers several key benefits. Firstly, it is permissionless, meaning it is a public contract not owned or controlled by any individual or organization. Secondly, it provides various tooling options such as indexing and access-management integrations, making it convenient for developers. Lastly, if you have a great idea but lack the technical expertise to build it, AttestationStation can be a valuable resource.\n\nWhen using attestations, it is important to prioritize user privacy. Attestations create log entries that become part of the permanent record on the blockchain. To protect users' privacy, explicit consent should be obtained for collecting personal information. Users should be clearly informed about the data being collected, the purpose of collection, and how it will be used. To ensure data security, sensitive information can be stored offchain using encryption, proper authentication, and authorization measures.\n\nAttestations should not be seen as replacements for verifiable credentials or decentralized identifiers. Instead, they can be used by developers to create decentralized identifiers, credentials, claims, and more. Attestations and the associated web of trust work in conjunction with proof of personhood solutions like WorldID. This combination helps prevent sybil-attacks and provides additional information about a person's reputation, which is crucial in governance and other use-cases. \n\nAttestations also offer benefits over soulbound/non-transferable tokens, such as flexibility in choosing whether the attestation is onchain or offchain and improved interoperability.",

      "content": "The Optimist Profile is a platform that allows individuals and organizations to showcase their contributions and impact within the Optimism Collective. It is built using onchain reputation data on OP Mainnet and offers various elements to create a comprehensive profile. \n\nIt comprises of the following elements:\n\n### Profile Schema\nThis is an onchain self-attestation using a profile schema that represents an individual or organization. It provides a standardized format to present information about oneself or one's organization.\n\n### Contributions\nEach Optimist Profile can create onchain attestations about their contributions to the Optimism Collective. This means that users can highlight the specific ways in which they have made a positive impact within the community.\n\n### Peer-to-Peer Attestations\nOptimist Profiles can also be used to create onchain peer-to-peer (p2p) attestations about the contributions of other contributors. This helps to establish a web of trust within the Optimism Collective, as individuals can vouch for the contributions of their peers.\n\nThe Optimist Profile is built on attestations using the Ethereum Attestation Service. It utilizes specific profile schema and application schema UIDs to store and retrieve relevant information. The profile schema UID represents the profile itself, while the application schema UID represents the specific application being used.\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/cea98e6c_5be8_4da2_85a8_eba46b4319c5/1695362591843_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\n[Profile schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xac4c92fc5c7babed88f78a917cdbcdc1c496a8f4ab2d5b2ec29402736b2cf929): ​​0xac4c92fc5c7babed88f78a917cdbcdc1c496a8f4ab2d5b2ec29402736b2cf929\n\n- name: name of the profile\n- profileMetadataPtrType: used to determine the protocol\n- profileMetadataPtr: can be a URI, ipfs hash, etc. that points to any type of blob storage that stores the metadata\n\n\n[RetroPGF 3 Application schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0x76e98cce95f3ba992c2ee25cef25f756495147608a3da3aa2e5ca43109fe77cc): 0x76e98cce95f3ba992c2ee25cef25f756495147608a3da3aa2e5ca43109fe77cc\n\n- displayName: name of the application\n- applicationMetadataPtrType: used to determine the protocol\n- applicationMetadataPtr: can be a URI, ipfs hash, etc. that points to any type of blob storage that stores the metadata.\n\n\nThe Optimist Profile offers several benefits to its users.

      "content": "Schemas play a crucial role in AttestationStation as they define the structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation. These schemas act as a blueprint, ensuring that the data included in an attestation is organized and standardized. By following these predefined schemas, the information can be easily understood and processed by different systems.\n\nOn OP Mainnet, there are several relevant schemas being used. These schemas are identified by unique addresses:\n\n### General Schemas\n\n[Optimist Profile schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xac4c92fc5c7babed88f78a917cdbcdc1c496a8f4ab2d5b2ec29402736b2cf929): ​​0xac4c92fc5c7babed88f78a917cdbcdc1c496a8f4ab2d5b2ec29402736b2cf929\n\n[Gitcoin Passport V1 scores schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0x6ab5d34260fca0cfcf0e76e96d439cace6aa7c3c019d7c4580ed52c6845e9c89): 0x6ab5d34260fca0cfcf0e76e96d439cace6aa7c3c019d7c4580ed52c6845e9c89\n\n### RetroPGF Schemas\n\n[RetroPGF Badgeholders schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b): 0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b\n\n[RetroPGF 3 Application schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0x76e98cce95f3ba992c2ee25cef25f756495147608a3da3aa2e5ca43109fe77cc): 0x76e98cce95f3ba992c2ee25cef25f756495147608a3da3aa2e5ca43109fe77cc\n\n[RetroPGF 3 Lists schema UID](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0x3e3e2172aebb902cf7aa6e1820809c5b469af139e7a4265442b1c22b97c6b2a5): 0x3e3e2172aebb902cf7aa6e1820809c5b469af139e7a4265442b1c22b97c6b2a5\n\nEach schema specifies the structure and type of data that can be included in an attestation, ensuring consistency across different attestations.\n\nThe purpose of these schemas is to provide a standardized format for the data included in an attestation. This allows different systems and applications to easily interpret and process the information. By adhering to these schemas, developers can ensure that their attestations are compatible with the existing infrastructure and can be seamlessly integrated into the ecosystem.\n\nAttestationStation v1, the platform used for managing attestations, provides support for these schemas. It allows users to create attestations that adhere to the predefined schemas, ensuring that the data is structured correctly. This simplifies the process of creating and managing attestations, as users can rely on the predefined schemas to guide them.\n\nIn addition to providing structure and organization, schemas also contribute to the security and integrity of the attestations. By defining the type of data that can be included, schemas prevent the inclusion of malicious or unauthorized information. This ensures that the attestations are reliable and trustworthy, as they follow a predefined set of rules and standards.",

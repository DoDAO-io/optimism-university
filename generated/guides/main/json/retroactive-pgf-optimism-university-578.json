      "content": "RetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves.\n\nOne of the key benefits of RetroPGF is that it offers a possible exit liquidity for public goods projects. This means that it creates a market for early investment in these projects, allowing them to raise capital and bootstrap based on their early potential and promise. By compensating these projects for their positive contributions, RetroPGF encourages more innovation and funding in the development of public goods on Optimism.\n\nThe funding provided through RetroPGF is given to projects, companies, communities, or other entities that have already proven their value to the Optimism ecosystem. This approach is taken because it is easier to identify projects that have been useful in the past, rather than predicting their future usefulness. By rewarding projects that have already demonstrated their usefulness, RetroPGF ensures better capital allocation and encourages the development of public goods that have a tangible impact.\n\nBy injecting Silicon Valley-type financial incentives into projects building public goods, RetroPGF brings the profit-motive into the equation. This means that builders have the opportunity to raise capital and bootstrap from speculators or early investors who are seeking financial upside. This not only provides financial support for these projects but also encourages increased innovation and development within the Optimism ecosystem.",

      "content": "RetroPGF, or Retroactive Public Goods Funding, is a mechanism used by the Optimism Collective to reward entities and projects in the ecosystem that have already provided a public good. The goal is to create a financial incentive for building public goods that benefit the ecosystem as a whole, even if there is no direct monetization model. This helps to foster a more diverse ecosystem of goods and services on the Optimism chain.\n\nThe way RetroPGF works is that the revenue generated by the sequencer, which is responsible for submitting the optimistic rollup transactions to Ethereum, is not retained entirely as profit. Instead, a portion of the revenue is distributed back to the Optimism Collective. This revenue is then used to fund public goods that have already been provided by entities and projects in the ecosystem.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retroactive_pgf_optimism_university_578/1695214631510_pic.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThe funding is distributed through a governance structure called the Citizens' House, which collectively decides on the distribution of funds. The Citizens' House votes quarterly on the allocation of funds to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a positive impact on the ecosystem. This creates a direct reward for community members for their contributions.\n\nRetroPGF also provides an opportunity for early investment in public goods projects, as it offers possible exit liquidity. This means that builders can be compensated for their positive contributions without relying solely on generating direct revenue. It also allows them to raise capital based on the potential and promise of their projects.\n\nThe end result of RetroPGF is a virtuous cycle. As more public goods are funded, the ecosystem becomes better, leading to increased demand for Optimism blockspace. This, in turn, generates more revenue for the sequencer, which can then be used for further retroactive public goods funding. This cycle continues to drive the growth and development of the ecosystem.\n\nThe governance structure ensures that the funding is allocated in a decentralized and fair manner, allowing for experimentation and maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public goods funding.",

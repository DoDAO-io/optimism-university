      "content": "### What is RetroPGF?\n\nRetroPGF, is an initiative that aims to provide financial support for public goods that are developed and utilized within the Optimism Stack (OP Stack). The idea behind RetroPGF is to reward builders who make a positive impact on the community by allowing them to profit from their contributions. It questions the purpose of building free software for the public good if there is no merit or benefit for the builder themselves.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retroactive_pgf_optimism_university_578/1695658585785_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Benefits of RetroPGF\n\n**Exit Liquidity for Public Goods Projects:** RetroPGF creates a market for early investment in public goods projects, offering them an exit liquidity option. This allows projects to raise capital and grow based on their early potential and contributions.\n\n**Encouragement of Innovation:** By compensating projects for their positive contributions, RetroPGF incentivizes innovation and funding in the development of public goods on Optimism.\n\n**Rewarding Proven Value:** RetroPGF allocates funding to projects, companies, communities, or entities that have demonstrated their value to the Optimism ecosystem in the past. This approach prioritizes projects with a track record of usefulness, ensuring more effective capital allocation.\n\n**Profit-Motive Integration:** RetroPGF introduces financial incentives similar to those in Silicon Valley, attracting speculators and early investors seeking financial gains. Builders have the opportunity to raise capital and bootstrap their projects, fostering increased innovation and development within the Optimism ecosystem.\n",

      "content": "RetroPGF, or Retroactive Public Goods Funding, is a mechanism used by the Optimism Collective to reward entities and projects in the ecosystem that have already provided a public good. The goal is to create a financial incentive for building public goods that benefit the ecosystem as a whole, even if there is no direct monetization model. This helps to foster a more diverse ecosystem of goods and services on the Optimism chain.\n\n### How RetroPGF Works?\n\nThe way RetroPGF works is that the revenue generated by the sequencer, which is responsible for submitting the optimistic rollup transactions to Ethereum, is not retained entirely as profit. Instead, a portion of the revenue is distributed back to the Optimism Collective. This revenue is then used to fund public goods that have already been provided by entities and projects in the ecosystem.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/retroactive_pgf_optimism_university_578/1695216009876_untitled-2023-09-20-1744.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThe funding is distributed through a governance structure called the Citizens' House, which collectively decides on the distribution of funds. The Citizens' House votes quarterly on the allocation of funds to individuals, teams, projects, or communities that have made a positive impact on the ecosystem. This creates a direct reward for community members for their contributions.\n\nRetroPGF also provides an opportunity for early investment in public goods projects, as it offers possible exit liquidity. This means that builders can be compensated for their positive contributions without relying solely on generating direct revenue. It also allows them to raise capital based on the potential and promise of their projects.\n\nThe end result of RetroPGF is a virtuous cycle. As more public goods are funded, the ecosystem becomes better, leading to increased demand for Optimism blockspace. This, in turn, generates more revenue for the sequencer, which can then be used for further retroactive public goods funding. This cycle continues to drive the growth and development of the ecosystem.",

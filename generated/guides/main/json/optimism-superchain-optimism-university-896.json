      "content": "The Optimism Superchain is an advanced technology that aims to solve the major challenges faced by blockchain networks, such as scalability and transaction fees, without causing fragmentation in the ecosystem. Currently, there are multiple Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain networks, each with their own tokens, features, and user communities. While this provides more options for users and developers, it also creates a fragmented ecosystem that hampers the growth of the crypto industry.\n\nThe fragmented ecosystem limits the network effects that are crucial for the success of blockchain projects. Smaller user bases result in less security, innovation, and overall adoption rates. Moreover, transferring value or data between different chains becomes complex and costly, leading to inefficiencies and reduced usability. This confusion and uncertainty make it difficult for new users to enter the blockchain space. Additionally, developers face challenges in building applications that work across multiple chains, which limits innovation and reduces the number of developers willing to work on blockchain projects.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_superchain_optimism_university_896/1695822442713_capture.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nTo address these issues, Optimism has developed the Superchain, which is a network of chains that share security, a communication layer, and a development stack. This horizontally scalable system allows for massive scale, novel applications, and a new revenue model that rewards developers for the fees generated by their chains. The Superchain is built on the OP Stack, a fully open-source and modular development stack that sets the standard for decentralized infrastructure.\n\nBy implementing the Superchain, Optimism aims to significantly increase the transaction throughput of Ethereum, allowing more users to utilize the network without congestion or high fees. However, relying on a single chain can lead to centralization, and the implementation of this complex solution requires extensive development and testing. Furthermore, users need to adopt a new solution, which can be a barrier to adoption and limit scalability improvements.\n",

      "content": "The concept of upgrading optimism to become a superchain involves implementing several changes to the existing system in order to create a more efficient and secure network:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_superchain_optimism_university_896/1695394694138_untitled-2023-09-22-1859.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Initial Superchain\nTo create an initial superchain, it is necessary to put all information defining the L2 chain on-chain. This includes generating a unique chain ID and configuring key values such as block gas limit. By doing so, a factory can be created to deploy the configuration and all other required contracts for each chain. This allows for the deployment and upgrade of multiple chains with the same bridge, making it more efficient and cost-effective.\n\n### Contract Addresses\nTo further enhance the superchain, contract addresses can be made deterministic using the CREATE2 function. This means that given a chain configuration, it is possible to determine all bridge addresses associated with that chain. This eliminates the need to deploy bridge contracts for each chain, making chain deployment virtually free. It also allows chains to inherit standard security properties, making the system more secure and reliable.\n\n### Permissionless Proposals\nIn the current system, withdrawals require a permissioned entity known as the proposer. This introduces overhead and limits the number of chains in the superchain. To address this, permissionless proposals can be introduced, allowing anyone to submit a withdrawal proposal. This removes the need for a designated proposer and enables users to submit their own withdrawal messages. Additionally, the proposal submission interval can be removed, allowing withdrawal claims to be made only when a user needs to withdraw. This streamlines the process and improves efficiency.\n\n### Permissionless Proof System\nTo enable permissionless proposals and withdrawal claims, a permissionless proof system can be introduced. In the envisioned fault proof system, anyone can submit a withdrawal claim at any time. These claims can be permissionless when accompanied by bonds, which act as collateral. If a claim is proven to be invalid, the bond is paid out to the challenger, preventing spam and ensuring the security of the system. The fault proof system relies on a trusted set of chain attestors to arbitrate disputes and prioritize safety over liveness.\n\n### Sequencer Decentralization\nTo achieve sequencer decentralization, the sequencer address can be configured by the OP Chain deployer. This allows different entities to sequence OP Chains while retaining the standard security model. Safety is guaranteed by the proof system, and liveness is ensured by the ability to submit transactions directly to L1. Modular sequencing also enables permissionless experimentation with different sequencing models, fostering competition and innovation.\n\n### Decentralized Security Council\nTo ensure security and decentralization, a decentralized security council should be introduced to govern upgrades. This council would have the authority to update chain attestors, initiate contract upgrades with a delay, and pause the bridge in case of emergencies. The ability to pause the bridge prevents the loss of funds and ensures the safety of the system. In case of a security breach, the council can indefinitely pause withdrawals and cancel pending upgrades, protecting the network and user funds.",

      "content": "### What is Token House?\n\nToken House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum, community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. \n\nThe Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast their votes on-chain.\n\n### How to become a Token House Member?\n\nThere are several avenues available for obtaining OP tokens and becoming a part of the Optimism ecosystem. One common method is through airdrops, which involve the distribution of tokens to eligible users based on specific criteria. Airdrops are frequently employed to recognize early adopters, active participants, or contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to acquire OP tokens is through cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, Crypto.com offers a user-friendly platform for purchasing and trading OP tokens. By setting up an account and completing the required verification process, users gain access to the OP token market and can commence trading.\n\nFurthermore, engagement within the Optimism ecosystem presents opportunities for earning OP tokens. Individuals who contribute to the development, testing, or promotion of Optimism's technology may qualify for token rewards or incentives. Staying connected with the Optimism community and keeping abreast of the network's official communication channels enables contributors to stay informed about potential avenues for earning tokens.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Role of OP Token Holders\n\n**Participation in Decentralized Governance:** OP token holders have the opportunity to participate in the decentralized governance of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n**Proposal Rights:** They can propose changes, updates, and enhancements to the protocol.\n\n**Voting Privileges:** OP token holders can cast votes on important matters such as protocol upgrades and fee structures.\n\n**Shaping the Network's Future:** Through their proposals and votes, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future development and direction of the Optimism network.\n\n### Proposals\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651189435_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nGrant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the [Grants Council: Internal Operating Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832). Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) and contain relevant information.\n\n### Voting on Proposals\n\nCurrently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract. However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and follow the specified voting process. \n\nTo move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.\n\n### Future Submissions\n\nIf a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and refinement before moving forward in the governance process.",

      "content": "A Token House governance proposal is considered valid when it meets specific criteria related to the number of votes:\n\n### Quorum\nThis refers to the minimum number of total OP votes, which includes abstain votes, that must be cast for a proposal to be eligible. Quorum is calculated as a percentage of the total votable OP supply at the start of the voting period. The \"votable supply\" encompasses the OP tokens that have been delegated and are eligible to participate in the voting process. \n\n### Approval Threshold\nTo approve a proposal, a minimum number of OP votes must be in favor of it. The approval threshold for each proposal is determined as a percentage of the votes cast in favor of approval relative to the total number of yes and no votes. Abstain votes are not included in this calculation.\n\nThe table below showcases different requirements for submission and approval of each proposal type:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Proposal Type</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <th>Submission Requirements</th>\n    <th>Vote Duration</th>\n    <th>Quorum</th>\n    <th>Approval Threshold</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Governance Fund</td>\n    <td>OP grants to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.</td>\n    <td>Proposals should follow <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-phase-1-how-to-create-a-proposal/216\">this template</a> and the process outlined in <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832\">Grants Council: Internal Procedures</a>.</td>\n    <td>Three-week review cycle plus two week Grants Council vote window</td>\n    <td>N/A</td>\n    <td>See <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832\">Grants Council: Internal Procedures</a>.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Protocol Upgrade</td>\n    <td>Scheduled changes to the on-chain smart contracts comprising the mainnet Optimism protocol</td>\n    <td>Forum + On-Chain Voting</td>\n    <td>Three-week review cycle plus two week vote window</td>\n    <td>30%</td>\n    <td>76%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Inflation Adjustment</td>\n    <td>Changes to the inflation rate of newly minted OP (currently capped at 2% annually)</td>\n    <td>Forum + On-Chain Voting.

      "content": "### Seasons & Voting Cycles\n\nSeasons are distinct periods of governance operations, each with its own unique timeline and objectives. These seasons are organized and scheduled to facilitate decision-making and governance within the Token House ecosystem. \n\nVoting cycles are specific phases within a season during which token holders participate in the governance process. These cycles typically last for five weeks and serve as the primary periods for proposing, discussing, and voting on governance proposals. \n\nThese cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the community actively participates in voting on various proposals.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/token_house_optimism_university_389/1695651303092_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nReflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve deeper into how these cycles work.\n\n### Reflection Periods\nReflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.\n\nTo allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.\n\n### Special Voting Cycles\nFollowing the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.\n\nTo stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and progression of the governance process.",

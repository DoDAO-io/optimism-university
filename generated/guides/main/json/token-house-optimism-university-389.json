      "content": "Token House is an integral part of the Optimism Collective's governance structure. It was established alongside the launch of the OP token, which was distributed to addresses that demonstrated positive-sum, community-oriented behavior through Airdrop #1. As members of Token House, OP holders have the responsibility to participate in the governance process by submitting, deliberating, and voting on various proposals.\n\nThe Token House Governance Contract serves as the on-chain voting contract for all governance proposals submitted by Token House members. This is where all qualifying proposals are submitted for voting. To facilitate the voting process, the Optimism Governance Portal provides a user-friendly interface for Token House members to delegate their voting power and cast their votes on-chain.\n\nThe Optimism Forum plays a crucial role in the governance process by providing a platform for discussion and deliberation on governance proposals. It serves as a space where Token House members can engage in meaningful conversations and share their perspectives. In the future, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance councils may be developed to further enhance the governance experience.\n\n### Proposals\n\nGrant proposals, known as Season 3 grant applications, are reviewed by the Grants Council and follow a separate submission process outlined in the [Grants Council: Internal Operating Procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832). Non-grant proposals, on the other hand, should be posted on the [Forum](http://gov.optimism.io/) for review by the entire Optimism community. These proposals must be formatted according to the [standard proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) and contain relevant information.\n\n### Voting Process\n\nCurrently, voting takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract. However, the implementation of successful votes is administered by the Optimism Foundation, which may change in the future. To proceed to the voting stage, a proposal must be one of the valid proposal types and follow the specified voting process. \n\nTo move a non-grant proposal to the voting stage, it must receive explicit approval from four delegates, each holding more than 0.25% of the current votable token supply. Delegates can signal their approval by posting a specific comment on the proposal discussion thread. However, their approval does not imply an endorsement of the proposal, but rather indicates that they believe the proposal is ready for voting. Once a proposal receives four delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the title and provide a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 3.\n\n### Future Submissions\n\nIf a proposal author does not receive explicit delegate approval or wishes to gather more feedback, they can continue seeking input from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle. This ensures that proposals have ample opportunity for improvement and refinement before moving forward in the governance process.",

      "content": "Reflection Periods and Special Voting Cycles are integral parts of the governance system that the Optimism Foundation follows. These cycles allow for the adoption of proposals and the modification of the collective's structure based on feedback received during the previous season. Let's delve deeper into how these cycles work.\n\nDuring each Season, Token House voting takes place through five-week voting cycles. These cycles commence on Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST) and conclude on Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00 PST). It is during these cycles that the community actively participates in voting on various proposals.\n\n### Reflection Periods\nReflection Periods play a crucial role in the governance process. During these periods, the Optimism Foundation publishes a proposed changelog to the Operating Manual and a set of governance proposals. These proposals aim to address the feedback received in the previous season, ensuring that the collective's decisions align with the community's needs.\n\nTo allow delegates and the broader community ample time to provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, there are no active votes during Reflection Periods. This period serves as a dedicated time for reflection and constructive discussions, enabling the community to contribute to the enhancement of the upcoming season.\n\n### Special Voting Cycles\nFollowing the Reflection Periods, Special Voting Cycles are conducted. These cycles focus specifically on voting for proposals that aim to modify the collective's structure. It is during these cycles that the changes made during the Reflection Period are voted upon. This ensures that the collective's structure remains adaptable and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.\n\nTo stay up to date with the seasons and voting cycles, the governance calendar provides all the necessary information. It serves as a valuable resource for the community, offering insights into the timing and progression of the governance process.\n\n### History of Seasons\n \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/fafe5568_1afc_459c_927f_43d06d81aaf5/1695650814314_untitled-2023-09-25-1547.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n",

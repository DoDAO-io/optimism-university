      "content": "In the world of blockchain development, transaction debugging tools play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth execution of transactions and identifying any issues that may arise. These tools provide developers with valuable insights into the state of their contracts and help them trace the flow of transactions. In this article, we will explore two popular transaction debugging tools: \n\n### Tenderly\n\n[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) is a powerful tool that allows developers to inspect the execution of transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet or Goerli testnet. With Tenderly, you can dive deep into the state of your verified contract at any step of the transaction's execution. This level of detail not only reduces development time but also enhances your understanding of how transactions flow. Additionally, Tenderly enables you to step into or over function calls, providing further insights into the execution process.\n\n### Etherscan\n\n[Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/), another widely used transaction debugging tool, offers a range of features to help developers analyze transactions. By using Etherscan, you can not only view events associated with a transaction but also access revert messages. This information is invaluable in identifying any errors or unexpected behavior that may have occurred during the transaction's execution. Etherscan supports both the OP Mainnet and the Goerli testnet, making it a versatile tool for developers.\n\n### Blockscout\n\nWhile Tenderly and Etherscan are well-known transaction debugging tools, it's worth mentioning Blockscout as well. Blockscout provides developers with the ability to view events on both the [OP Mainnet](https://optimism.blockscout.com/) and the [Goerli](https://optimism-goerli.blockscout.com/) testnet. By leveraging Blockscout, developers can gain insights into the events associated with their transactions, allowing them to track the flow of data and identify any potential issues.\n",

      "content": "### What are Network Faucets?\n\nNetwork faucets are services that provide users with testnet Ether (ETH) on various test networks. These faucets are specifically designed for development and testing purposes. They allow developers to experiment and test their applications without using real cryptocurrencies. By distributing testnet ETH, network faucets enable developers to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure the functionality and security of their applications.\n\n### Types of Network Faucets\n\nThere are several types of network faucets available for developers: \n\n#### Superchain Faucet\n\nOne popular option is the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet), which allows users to claim free testnet Ether on testnet OP Chains like OP Goerli. This developer tool is useful for testing applications on specific test networks. \n\n#### Paradigm MultiFaucet\n\n[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is another convenient option that provides ETH on multiple testnets simultaneously. This makes it easier for developers to access testnet ETH for various testing purposes.\n\n### Using Coinbase & QuickNode\n\n[Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) users have the advantage of obtaining test ETH directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or through the [Coinbase Faucet website](https://coinbase.com/faucets/optimism-goerli-faucet). This integration simplifies the process of acquiring testnet ETH for OP Goerli. Another option is the Optimism Faucet for Goerli by [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/goerli), which offers an effortless way to acquire testnet ETH for OP Goerli. These user-friendly faucets make it convenient for developers to access the necessary resources for testing their applications.\n\n### Bridging Testnet ETH to OP Goerli\n\nIn some cases, developers may need to obtain L1 Goerli ETH from an Ethereum testnet faucet and then use the Optimism Bridge interface to bridge the testnet ETH to/from OP Goerli. This process allows developers to transfer testnet ETH between different networks, enabling them to test the functionality and compatibility of their applications across multiple environments. Additionally, if developers require ETH on OP Mainnet for contract deployment, they can bridge [ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to OP Mainnet](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).\n\n### Bridging USDC for Expenses\n\nFor developers who need ETH for expenses, there is an alternative option available. By bridging enough USDC courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/), developers can obtain ETH to cover their expenses. This provides developers with a convenient way to access the necessary funds for testing and deploying their applications.",

      "content": "Oracles: Providing Offchain Data Onchain\n\nOracles are incredibly useful tools in the world of blockchain technology. They allow code running on a blockchain to access a wide range of information, providing offchain data onchain. One common use case for oracles is in stablecoins that accept ETH as collateral. These stablecoins need to know the ETH/USD exchange rate to determine how many stablecoins can be given to a user for a specific amount of ETH. Oracles play a crucial role in providing this information.\n\nTypes of Oracles: Push and Pull\n\nThere are two main types of oracles: push oracles and pull oracles. Push oracles continuously update and always have up-to-date information available onchain. On the other hand, pull oracles are only updated when information is requested by a contract. Pull oracles can be further divided into two types: double-transaction oracles and single-transaction oracles. Double-transaction oracles require two transactions, where the first transaction requests information and triggers an offchain mechanism to provide the answer. The second transaction reads the result from the oracle and uses it. Single-transaction oracles, like Chainlink's random number generator, only require one transaction and use a callback to inform a contract of the result.\n\nGas Oracle: Providing Gas Price Information\n\nGas Oracle is a push oracle that provides information about gas prices and related parameters. It can calculate the total cost of a transaction before it is sent. This oracle is available on OP Mainnet and OP Goerli. Gas price parameters are updated onchain whenever there are changes, but the L1 gas price is only pushed once every 5 minutes and can change by up to 20% each time.\n\nChainlink: Price Feeds for Up-to-Date Information\n\nChainlink is another popular oracle provider that offers a variety of price feeds. These price feeds provide up-to-date information that can be accessed onchain. Developers can use Chainlink feeds to get the latest information for their applications. Chainlink's feeds are widely used and can be integrated into various blockchain projects.\n\nTellor: A Customizable and Secure Oracle\n\nTellor is a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and customizable oracle. It allows users to put any verifiable data onchain, including spot price feeds, TWAPs, random numbers, and EVM calldata. Tellor has a mechanism to reward entities that provide accurate information and penalize those that provide incorrect information. It operates as a pull oracle, where users fund specific feeds to get updated data reports. However, under certain circumstances, it can also act as a push oracle.\n\nBand: Onchain Randomness Source\n\nBand is an oracle provider that offers onchain randomness. It provides a source of verifiable randomness that can be used in various applications. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require random number generation or other forms of onchain randomness.\n\nUMA: Generic Oracle for Information Requests\n\nUMA is a generic oracle that allows any contract to request information by asking a question. Staked entities can provide answers, and external entities can dispute the proposed answer by providing their own answer and staking their tokens. The majority of token holders who vote truthfully are rewarded. UMA operates as a pull oracle, meaning that information is not obtained until it is requested by a contract. This requires two transactions, with the first transaction triggering the request and the second transaction retrieving the response.\n\nUniswap: Providing Asset Quotes\n\nAlthough technically not an oracle, Uniswap pools provide quotes that give the relative costs of assets. These quotes can be used to determine asset prices, but it's important to note that relying solely on onchain asset prices, especially in low liquidity pools, can leave one vulnerable to price manipulation. To use Uniswap as an oracle, one can find the pool address by looking at the Uniswap factory and use specific parameters to retrieve the pool state.\n\nIn conclusion, oracles are incredibly useful tools in the blockchain ecosystem. They provide offchain data onchain, allowing smart contracts to access a wide range of information. Different types of oracles, such as push oracles and pull oracles, offer different functionalities and levels of decentralization. Various oracle providers, including Gas Oracle, Chainlink, Tellor, Band, UMA, and Uniswap, offer specific features and services to cater to different needs within the blockchain space. These oracles play a crucial role in enabling the development of decentralized applications and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data on the blockchain.",

      "content": "The Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole.\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

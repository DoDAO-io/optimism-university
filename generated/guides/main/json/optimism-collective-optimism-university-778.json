      "content": "# What is Optimism Collective?\n\nThe Optimism Collective is a revolutionary concept that aims to reshape the way we organize and govern ourselves in the digital age. In the current cyberspace, we face a significant market failure because the economic rules that govern it were designed for the physical world. However, cyberspace is built on information, which can be freely replicated, making public goods crucial for its growth. Unfortunately, our markets are not equipped to nurture this growth and reward the creators of these public goods for their impact.\n\nThe Optimism Collective seeks to change this by introducing a new model of digital democratic governance. It is a coalition of communities, companies, and citizens who have come together with a shared goal: to reward positive impact with profit. This principle, impact=profit, serves as their guiding light, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The Collective aims to dispel the misconception that public goods cannot be profitable and consistently provides retroactive incentives for public goods that benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. The following diagram showcases the two governing bodies of Optimism Collective: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1696853494210_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n# Mechanism of OP Collective\n\nBy incentivizing the creation of public goods, the Optimism Collective propels the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. As the Collective expands, so does the scope of what falls under the umbrella of public goods. They envision a future where the Collective extends beyond the digital realm and into the physical world, reliably providing for basic human needs at scale. While this may seem idealistic today, they approach it with an overwhelming sense of optimism and a belief that it will become commonplace in the future.\n\nThe Optimism Collective operates on the belief that public goods and profitability can go hand in hand. Often, public goods are underfunded because the incentives are not properly aligned, forcing individuals and organizations to choose between profit and the common good. However, the Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, where impact equals profit. They deploy a new model called retroactive public goods funding, which rewards those who create or sustain public goods. This funding mechanism is advantageous because it is easier to identify what is useful and who built it, rather than predicting future usefulness and the best team to build it.\n\nRetroactive public goods funding also encourages initial investment in public good development by offering the possibility of an eventual exit payment. This mirrors the way investors fund startups today, with the potential for an IPO or buyout. By aligning incentives and providing retroactive funding, the Optimism Collective aims to support projects and communities that are building for the common good and creating a sustainable future for Ethereum.",

It encourages and enables the community to contribute to the technical architecture of the protocol. Additionally, the Foundation commissions technical research on scalability, security, and decentralization, ensuring that the Optimism protocol remains robust and reliable. By supporting the development of the protocol, the Foundation contributes to the growth and success of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n### Future Goals\nWhile the Optimism Foundation currently provides administrative services and support, its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors in creating the technical and governance foundations that will allow for decentralization over time. The Foundation recognizes the importance of empowering the community and gradually reducing its own role. This approach ensures that the Collective becomes self-sustaining and capable of making independent decisions in the future.",

      "content": "The Optimism Foundation operates under a well-defined structure and set of processes to ensure effective governance and accountability. Let's take a closer look at the foundation's work processes and how they contribute to its smooth functioning:\n\n### Governing Body\nThe foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, which currently consists of Abbey Titcomb, Ben Jones, Brian Avello, Eva Beylin, and Jing. The board's primary role is to manage the foundation's business and affairs. They oversee the foundation's directors and ensure that they fulfill their legal obligations. Additionally, a supervisor is appointed to provide guidance and support to the board.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1696853597520_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Employment\nTo execute its operational and administrative aims, the foundation employs officers, contractors, and service providers. These individuals and entities play a crucial role in carrying out the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the foundation. They work closely with the board and other stakeholders to ensure the smooth functioning of the foundation.\n\n### Legal Accountability\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation company, the Optimism Foundation is legally accountable to its governing documentation. This documentation establishes the foundation's commitment to defer to the will of the Optimism Collective and its governance. The foundation is required to observe and implement the outcome of valid governance votes diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner. However, the foundation's discretion is limited to proposals that are unsafe, insecure, inconsistent with its purpose, legally non-compliant, or would hinder its ability to function effectively.",

      "content": "To ensure accountability and transparency, the foundation has implemented three governance proposal types. These proposals are designed to protect the rights of OP token holders and maintain transparency within the organization. By having these proposals in place, the foundation aims to align its financial resources with the collective's interests and priorities:\n\n### Vote for Disbursement\nThe foundation's financial resources are subject to an annual vote. This means that the amount of OP tokens available for disbursement are determined through a vote by the collective. By involving the collective in this decision-making process, the foundation ensures that its financial resources are allocated in a manner that aligns with the interests and priorities of the token holders.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_collective_optimism_university_778/1696853644048_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Director Removal\nThe governance has the authority to remove any member of the foundation's Board of Directors from service. This power is crucial in holding board members accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows for the removal of any director who fails to fulfill their responsibilities or acts against the best interests of the foundation. By having this authority, the governance ensures that the board members are held to a high standard and that their actions are in line with the foundation's goals.\n\n### Power to Veto\nThe Token House, representing the OP token holders, has the power to veto any proposed changes to the foundation's governing documents that would significantly reduce the rights of OP token holders. This mechanism serves as a safeguard for the interests and rights of the token holders. It ensures that their voices are heard and respected, and that any changes to the governing documents are in line with their best interests. By giving the Token House this power, the foundation demonstrates its commitment to protecting the rights of the token holders.",

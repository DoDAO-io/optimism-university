      "content": "### What is a Bridge?\n\nBridges are responsible for holding assets on a layer-1 blockchain while those same assets are released on another service. This defines who has custody of the funds and the conditions that must be met before the assets can be unlocked. The withdrawal request destroys coins on the off-chain system and updates the bridge contract about the userâ€™s entitlement to withdraw their coins back to the Layer 1 blockchain. This allows users to move their coins back and forth between the two systems without having to worry about losing any of their value.\n\n### What is Layer-2?\n\nLayer-2 (L2) is a secondary layer built on top of a main blockchain (Layer-1 or L1) to improve its speed and scalability. It helps process transactions faster and reduce congestion on the main blockchain. Examples include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Optimistic Rollups for Ethereum.\n\n### How Do Blockchain Bridges Work?\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_bridge_optimism_university_283/1695924760829_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThere are different mechanisms by which blockchain bridges facilitate asset transfers. \n\n**Burn & Mint:** One common method is the burn and mint approach. In this method, assets on the source chain are burned, meaning they are permanently removed from circulation, and an equal number of the same asset is minted on the destination chain. These newly minted assets are then transferred to the recipient.\n\n**Liquidity Pools:** Another method is through liquidity pools. Users contribute to liquidity pools on both the source and destination chains. When a cross-chain bridge event occurs, assets are deposited into the asset pool on one chain and withdrawn from the same asset pool on the other chain. This ensures that the liquidity is maintained throughout the transfer process.\n\n**Proxy tokens:** They are also used in some blockchain bridges. In this method, assets on one chain are locked in a smart contract, and an equivalent number of proxy tokens, also known as wrapped tokens, are minted and released on the destination chain. These proxy tokens represent the locked assets and can be freely traded or used on the destination chain.\n\nMost blockchain bridges are decentralized and permissionless. This means that anyone can use these bridges without needing approval or permission from a central authority. The decentralized nature ensures that the bridges are trustless and secure, as they rely on the consensus of multiple participants rather than a single entity.",

      "content": "By following these steps, you can easily bridge your tokens from Ethereum to Optimism using the Optimism Bridge:\n\n### Connect Wallet\nTo begin using the Optimism Bridge, you need to connect your wallet to the platform. Look for the \"Connect Wallet\" button either at the bottom or top-right corner of the page. Click on it and choose your preferred wallet. Follow the instructions provided to connect your wallet to the platform.\n\n### Choose the Source Chain\nOnce your wallet is connected, you will see a drop-down menu in the \"From\" section. This is where you choose your source chain or CEX (Centralized Exchange). For this guide, we will assume you are using Ethereum as the source chain. Select Ethereum from the drop-down menu.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/optimism-university/Guide/optimism_bridge_optimism_university_283/1695927205124_untitled-2023-09-21-1651.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Select the Token to Bridge\nAfter choosing the source chain, you need to select the specific token you want to bridge from the source chain to Optimism. Look for the token you wish to bridge and select it.\n\n### Confirm the Transaction\nOnce you have selected the token, a transaction will be initiated. You will need to confirm this transaction in your wallet. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the transaction confirmation process. This step ensures the secure transfer of your tokens.\nAfter confirming the transaction, you will need to wait for it to be confirmed on the Ethereum network. The time it takes for the bridging process to complete may vary depending on network traffic and the gas fees you choose to pay. It is important to be patient during this step.\n\n### Monitor the Transaction\nWhile waiting for the transaction to be confirmed, you can monitor its status on the Ethereum network using a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. This allows you to track the progress of your tokens as they move from the source chain to the Optimism network.\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, your tokens will be available on the Optimism network. This means you can now use your bridged tokens on Optimism and take advantage of its benefits and features.",
